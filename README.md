#Part II: Ideological Foundations
## -Recognition of natural and sustainable laws-
-----
# Chapter 1: The Four Principles of Human Survival
-----
1.1 Overview of the Four Principles
In order for humanity to build a sustainable civilization, it is necessary to understand and practice basic principles based on natural and sustainable laws.
This chapter defines the four principles of human survival and clarifies their significance.
-----
### Definition of the Four Principles
1. Law of Nature /  Providence  2. Harmony  3. Circulation / Cycle  4. Structure
These four principles are not independent, but rather form an integrated system that is interrelated and supports each other.
-----
1.2 First Principle: Law of Nature / Providence
### Definition
**Providence is the fundamental structure and laws of the universe and nature.**
It exists independently of human will or desire and is a universal law that governs all phenomena.
### Basic concepts
#### The immutability of providence
Providence has the following characteristics:
- **Universality**: Applies across time and space  - **Immutability**: Cannot be artificially altered  - **Necessity**: Works without exception  - **Objectivity**: Does not depend on the observer
#### Examples of Providence
Physical Providence:
- Law of gravity  - Law of thermodynamics (increase in entropy)  - Law of conservation of energy
Biological Providence:
- The birth, growth, and death of life  - The evolution of species  - Ecological balance
Earth science providence:
- Water cycle  - Atmospheric cycle  - Crustal movements
### Human civilization and providence
#### Adaptation to Providence vs. Rebellion against Providence
**Examples of applications:**
- Agriculture: Follow the cycle of the seasons  - Architecture: Respond to gravity and climate  - Medicine: Support the body's natural healing powers
**Examples of rebellion:**
- Mass consumption of fossil fuels: Destruction of the carbon cycle  - Mass production and mass waste: Ignorance of material cycles  - Destruction of ecosystems: Disregard for biodiversity
#### The result of ignoring providence
Lessons from history:
1. **Collapse of Civilization**
- Mesopotamia: Devastation of farmland due to salt damage  - Easter Island: Ecosystem collapse due to deforestation  - Mayan civilization: Depletion of water resources
1. **Modern Crisis**
- Climate change: destruction of the carbon cycle  - Marine pollution: disregard for material cycles  - Loss of biodiversity: destruction of ecosystems
### Recognition of providence
**For humanity to survive:**
1. **Humility**: Abandon the arrogance of believing you can control nature.  1. **Observation**: Deeply understand the laws of nature.  1. **Adaptation**: Build technological and social systems that are in line with nature's laws  . 1. **Respect**: Respect nature and coexist with it.
-----
## 1.3 Second principle: Harmony
### Definition
**Harmony is maintaining a balance between nature, society, and individuals.**
It means coexistence rather than conflict, cooperation rather than domination, and distribution rather than monopoly.
### Three-layered structure of harmony
#### 1. Harmony with nature
**Coexistence between humans and the natural environment**
- Sustainable use of resources  - Preservation of ecosystems  - Climate stabilization  - Maintenance of biodiversity
**Examples of lost harmony:**
- Heat island phenomenon: the incongruity between cities and nature  - Marine dead zones: the incongruity between human activities and the ocean  - Increase in forest fires: the incongruity between climate change and forests
#### 2. Harmony with society
**Human coexistence**
- Respect for cultural diversity  - Reducing economic disparities  - Promoting international cooperation  - Intergenerational equity
**Current state of disharmony:**
- Widening gap between rich and poor  - Conflict over resources  - Cultural and religious clashes  - Debt to future generations (environmental destruction, fiscal deficits)
#### 3. Harmony with the individual
**Harmony with Self**
- Physical and mental health  - Mental stability  - Purpose in life  - Inner peace
Symptoms of disharmony:
- Stressful society  - Increase in mental illness  - Death from overwork and suicide  - Loss of meaning in life
### How to achieve harmony
#### Principle
1. **Dialogue**: Deepening mutual understanding  1. **Compromise**: Aiming for overall optimization  1. **Empathy**: Understanding other people's perspectives  1. **Tolerance**: Accepting differences
#### Practice
- **Respect for diversity**: Recognizing different values  - **Coexistence and co-prosperity**: Building win-win relationships  - **Altruism**: Considering the interests of others as one's own  - **Fairness**: Fair distribution of resources and opportunities
-----
## 1.4 Third principle: Circulation / Cycle
### Definition
**Circulation is the continuous flow of resources, energy, and life.**
It means a cycle rather than a one-way street, metabolism rather than consumption, and regeneration rather than disposal.
### Cycles of nature
#### 1. Water Cycle
Evaporation  → Clouds → Rainfall → Rivers → Oceans →  Evaporation
- Powered by solar energy  - Global circulation  - Source of freshwater
**Man-made destruction:**
- Blockage of flow by dams  - Overextraction of groundwater  - Water pollution
#### 2. Carbon Cycle
Atmospheric  CO2 → Photosynthesis → Organic matter → Respiration/Decomposition →  CO2
- Approximately 10 billion tons/year of natural circulation  - Oceans and forests are sinks
**Man-made destruction:**
- Fossil fuel burning: Approximately 40 billion tons of CO2 emitted annually  - Deforestation: Loss of carbon sink  - Ocean acidification: Decrease in absorption capacity
#### 3. Nutrient cycling
Surface  → Biological production → Death and sinking → Deep layer → Upwelling →  Surface
- Supporting ocean productivity  - Vertical circulation is key
**Man-made destruction:**
- Stratification due to global warming  - Cessation of vertical circulation  - Expansion of dead zones
### The cycle of human society
#### Circular systems in traditional societies
**Japan in the Edo Period:**
- Excrement → Fertilizer → Crops → Food → Excrement  - Clothing: Kimono → Rags → Cloths → Fuel  - Construction: Wood → Construction → Demolition → Reuse
**result:**
- Nearly 100% resource recycling  - Maintaining a sustainable society for 300 years
Modern Linear Systems
Resource  extraction → production → consumption →  disposal
**Problem:**
- Resource depletion  - Waste accumulation  - Environmental pollution  - Unsustainable
### Rebuilding circulation
#### The circular economy we should strive for
**principle:**
1. **Reduce**: Reduce waste  1. **Reuse**: Use repeatedly  1. **Recycle**: Return to resources  1. **Regenerate**: Recover using the power of nature
**Example:**
- Organic waste → Compost → Agriculture  - Waste plastic → Recycled plastic  - Sewage → Purification → Recycled water  - CO2 → Algae cultivation → Biofuel
-----
## 1.5 Fourth Principle: Structure
### Definition
**Structure is the design of stable social, technological and natural infrastructure.**
It means design rather than chance, reason rather than emotion, and the long term rather than the short term.
### The importance of structure
#### Why structure?
**Hope is not a feeling, it's a structure.**
- Emotion: temporary, unstable  - Structure: lasting, stable
**example:**
- "If we try hard enough, we can make it work" (emotion)  - vs  - "This system will last" (structure)
### Structural Design Principles
#### 1. Long-term perspective
**Short-term optimal vs. long-term optimal**
Short-term optimum example:
- Fossil fuels: convenient now, but a liability in the future  - Mass production: cheap now, but waste accumulation
Long-term optimal example:
- Renewable energy: Large initial investment, but sustainable  - Circular system: Complex design, but stable over the long term
#### 2. Systems Thinking
**Partial optimization vs. global optimization**
Suboptimal problem:
- Narrowing of perspective due to specialization  - Optimization of subsystems leads to deoptimization of the whole
The need for holistic optimization:
- Integrated perspective  - Understanding interactions  - Designing feedback loops
#### 3. Redundancy and Robustness
**Efficiency vs. Robustness**
Efficiency-focused vulnerabilities:
- Just-in-time production: Fails in the event of a disaster  - Dependence on a single power source: Paralyzed in the event of a power outage
Robust design:
- Redundancy: backup system  - Diversity: multiple options  - Diversification: risk distribution
#### 4. Adaptability
**Fixed vs Flexible**
Persistent system issues:
- Unable to adapt to environmental changes  - Unexpectedly fragile
Benefits of adaptive systems:
- Adaptable to change  - Learn and evolve  - Deal with unexpected situations
### Specific examples of structure
Ocean Breathing System
**Structural Features:**
1. **Long-term perspective**
- Centennial climate stabilization
1. **Systems Thinking**
- Considering the entire ocean circulation  - Integrating energy, nutrients, and CO2
1. **Redundancy**
- Combined solar, wind and tidal power generation  - Even if one unit breaks down, the whole system will continue to function
1. **Adaptability**
- Modular design  - Incremental expansion possible  - Room for improvement
**result:**
- Sustainable Climate Stabilization Systems  - Reproducible Structures of Hope
-----
## 1.6 Integration of the Four Principles
### Interrelationships
The four principles are not independent but mutually supportive:
Providence  : Foundation (Laws of Nature)  ↓  Harmony: Relationships (Balance)  ↓  Circulation: Dynamics (Flow)  ↓  Structure: Design (Sustainability)  ↓  Return to  Providence```
### Integration in Practice
**Implemented in Ocean Breathing System:**
1. **Providence**: Understand and mimic the natural circulation of the ocean  . 1. **Harmony**: Harmony between artificial and natural, symbiosis between technology and ecosystems  . 1. **Circulation**: Restoring the circulation of nutrients, CO2, and energy  . 1. **Structure**: Long-term stable design, reproducible hope.
-----
## 1.7 Summary
The four principles of human survival are:
1. **Providence**: Understanding and following the laws of nature  1. **Harmony**: Maintaining balance between nature, society, and oneself  1. **Circulation**: Circulating resources and energy  1. **Structure**: Designing systems that are stable over the long term
By putting these into practice, a sustainable civilization will be realized.
# Chapter 2: Subsidiary Principles and Practices
-----
2.1 Position of the Subsidiarity Principle
The four principles (providence, harmony, circulation, and structure) are the foundation for human survival, but more specific guidelines are needed to put them into practice.
The subsidiary principles presented in this chapter are intended to make the principle of harmony concrete and put it into everyday practice.
-----
### Five Pillars of Subsidiarity
1.  Understanding Nature  2. Coexistence & Co-prosperity 3.  Altruistic Symbiosis  4. Diversity  5. Tolerance
These are not independent principles, but are organically linked under the broad umbrella of "harmony."
-----
2.2 First Subsidiary Principle: Understanding Nature
### Definition
**Understanding nature means deeply learning about and recognizing the mechanisms, laws, and providence of nature.**
This is a prerequisite for practicing providence.
### Why understanding is necessary
The destruction caused by ignorance
**Historical Examples**
1. The Tragedy of DDT
- 1940s-60s: Used as a revolutionary insecticide  - Lack of understanding: No concept of bioaccumulation  - Result: Mass bird deaths, destruction of ecosystems  - Lesson learned: The danger of partial understanding
1. **Lessons from CFCs**
- 1930s-1980s: Popularized as an ideal refrigerant  - Lack of understanding: Unable to predict its impact on the ozone layer  - Result: Ozone hole formation  - Lesson learned: Importance of predicting long-term impacts
1. **Fossil Fuel Blind Spot**
- Post-industrial revolution: Energy revolution  - Lack of understanding: Impact on carbon cycle  - Consequences: Climate change  - Lessons learned: Need for a global perspective
### Deepening your understanding
Level 1: Superficial understanding
**Knowledge level**
- Memorization of facts  - Superficial causal relationships  - Single perspective
**example:**
- "Increased CO2 levels cause global warming"  - "Decreased forests are a problem"
#### Level 2: Understanding the Mechanism
**"I understand" level**
- Understanding the mechanisms  - Multiple causal relationships  - Systems perspective
**example:**
- "CO2 absorbs infrared rays and traps heat"  - "Forests absorb CO2 through photosynthesis and release oxygen"
Level 3: Integrated Understanding
**"Visible" level**
- See the big picture  - Understand interactions  - Predict long-term impacts
**example:**
- "Fossil fuel burning → Increased CO2 → Global warming → Rising sea surface temperature → Cessation of vertical circulation → Decrease in plankton → Decrease in CO2 absorption → Accelerated global warming"  - "Deforestation → Decrease in CO2 absorption + Soil erosion → River pollution → Marine eutrophication → Red tide → Decrease in fish population → Collapse of the food chain"
### Understanding in Practice

-----
2.3 Second Subsidiary Principle: Coexistence and Co-prosperity
### Definition
**Coexistence and co-prosperity means living and prospering together with nature and others.**
This means building win-win relationships, rather than a zero-sum game (someone's win is someone else's loss).
### Conventional thinking patterns
#### Domination/conquest type
**Paradigm of Western Modern Civilization**
Humans  > Nature >  Weak >  Developed > Developing
**result:**
- Environmental destruction  - Growing inequality  - Intensifying conflict  - Unsustainable
#### Competition and selection type
**The logic of capitalism**
Competition  → Selection of winners and losers  → Efficiency  growth → Infinite  expansion
**Problem:**
- Infinite growth is impossible on a finite planet  - Cutting off losers  - Ignoring environmental costs
### New thinking patterns
#### Symbiotic/cooperative type
**The Paradigm of Sustainable Civilization**
Humans  ⇄ Nature (Interdependence)  Strong ⇄ Weak (Mutual Support) Developed  Countries ⇄ Developing Countries (Mutual Cooperation)
**result:**
- Environmental conservation  - Reducing disparities  - Promoting cooperation  - Sustainable
### Practicing coexistence and prosperity
#### 1. Coexistence and prosperity with nature
**Traditional Agricultural Wisdom**
- Crop rotation: Allows the soil to rest  - Mixed cropping: Reduces pests and diseases  - Compost: Creates a cycle
**Integration with modern technology**
- Agroforestry: The fusion of forests and agriculture  - Permaculture: Sustainable agriculture  - Natural farming: Harnessing the power of nature
**Ocean Breathing System Example**
- Mimicking natural vertical circulation  - Collaboration between artificial and natural  - Coexistence with the marine ecosystem  - Result: Both thrive
#### 2. Coexistence and prosperity among humans
**International Cooperation**
Conventional:
- Competition for resources  - Zero-sum game  - Conflict and war
New shape:
- Sharing of technology (open source)  - Sharing of knowledge (educational support)  - Fair distribution of resources  - Result: Overall improvement
**Economic System**
Conventional:
- Unilateral exploitation  - Concentration of wealth  - Widening disparities
New shape:
- Fair Trade  - Social Enterprise  - Basic Income  - Outcome: Sustainable Prosperity
#### 3. Coexistence and prosperity between generations
**Responsibility of the current generation**
- Not leaving debt to the next generation  - Preserving the environment  - Building a sustainable system
**Rights of Future Generations**
- Clean air and water  - Stable climate  - Abundant nature  - Freedom of choice
-----
## 2.4 Third auxiliary principle: Altruism
### Definition
**Altruism is the idea that the interests of others are one's own interests.**
This means going beyond selfishness and building relationships in which altruism ultimately leads to self-interest.
### The limits of selfishness
#### Short-term selfishness
**"As long as I'm happy, that's all that matters."**
- Profiting even at the expense of the environment  - Growing at the expense of others  - Enjoying the present without regard for the future
**result:**
- Tragedy of the Commons  - Prisoner's Dilemma  - Total collapse
#### Long-term selfishness
**"For my future self"**
- Preserve the environment (secure future resources)  - Cooperate with others (secure future cooperation)  - Pursue sustainability (secure future stability)
**Problem:**
- Still selfish  - Only within the limits of what is calculable  - Unexpectedly vulnerable
### The idea of mutual benefit
#### Basic concepts
**"The happiness of others is your happiness"**
this is:
- Values, not calculations  - Gifts, not exchanges  - Unconditional, not conditions
#### Symbiosis in nature
**Examples of symbiosis**
1. **Rhizobium and plants**
- Rhizobium: Provides nitrogen fixation  - Plant: Provides sugars  - Result: Both survive and thrive
1. **Gut bacteria and humans**
- Bacteria: aids digestion  - Humans: provide shelter and nutrients  - Result: healthy symbiosis

2.5 Fourth Subsidiary Principle: Diversity
### Definition
**Diversity means recognizing and respecting different existences, values, and cultures.**
It means variety rather than uniformity, plurality rather than unity, and heterogeneity rather than homogeneity.
### The importance of diversity
#### Biological diversity
**Ecosystem Stability**
```  A highly diverse ecosystem:  - Even if some species become extinct, the whole can survive.  - It is easier to adapt to environmental changes.  - It prevents the spread of disease.
Low diversity ecosystems:  - The extinction of some species can cause the whole to collapse  - Vulnerable to environmental changes - Easily  susceptible to disease outbreaks
**Historical Lessons:**
- Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)  - Dependence on a single variety  - Complete destruction by disease  - Over 1 million people starved to death
Cultural diversity
**Humanity Richness**
Different cultures are:
- Have different wisdom  - Have different solutions  - Have different beauty
**example:**
- Indigenous people's wisdom on coexistence with nature  - Climate adaptation techniques in each region  - Diverse art, music, and literature
Technological diversity
**Source of innovation**
Single approach:
- When things get stuck, there's no way out  - Concentration of risk
Diverse approaches:
- Multiple solutions  - Risk diversification  - Mutual learning and evolution
-----
2.6 Fifth Subsidiary Principle: Tolerance
### Definition
**Tolerance is the tolerance and acceptance of those who are different from oneself.**
It means inclusion rather than exclusion, understanding rather than attack, and coexistence rather than domination.
### The consequences of intolerance
#### Historical tragedy
1. **Religious Wars**
- Intolerance of different faiths  - Hundreds of years of massacres
1. **Racism**
- Skin color intolerance  - slavery, genocide, discrimination
1. **Ideological oppression**
- Intolerance of different opinions  - Censorship, purges
Modern Intolerance
- Hate speech  - Xenophobia  - Fundamentalism  - Sectarian conflict
**result:**
- Social division  - Intensification of conflict  - Cycle of violence  - Inability to solve problems
### Practicing tolerance
#### Individual level
**Responding to different opinions**
Intolerance:
- Deciding that something is "wrong"  - Refusing to discuss it  - Attacking it
tolerance:
- Acknowledge that there are other ways of looking at things  - Attempt dialogue  - Try to understand
#### Social level
**System design**
- Guaranteeing freedom of speech  - Protecting minority rights  - Respecting diversity  - Creating a space for dialogue
Setting limits
**The Paradox of Tolerance**
Tolerance of intolerance is:
- Allowing intolerance to flourish  - Destroying a tolerant society
**Karl Popper's teachings:**
"To maintain a tolerant society, we must be intolerant of intolerance"
**Practice:**
- We respect diversity, but  - We do not tolerate violence  , - We do not tolerate discrimination  , - We demand dialogue in the face of refusals to dialogue.

2.7 Integration of Subsidiarity Principles
### Relationships among the five principles
 Understanding nature (  foundation)  Coexistence and mutual benefit ←→ Mutuality  ↓  Diversity ←→ Tolerance  ↓  Achieving  harmony
### Cycle of Practice
1. **Understanding** → Gaining a deeper understanding of nature and others  1. **Coexistence** → Building win-win relationships  1. **Altruism** → Wishing the happiness of others  1. **Diversity** → Recognizing differences  1. **Tolerance** → Accepting differences  1. **Harmony** → Achieving balance  1. **Understanding** → Leading to even deeper understanding (a cycle)
-----
## 2.8 Implementation in Ocean Breathing System
### Substantiation of the Subsidiarity Principle
#### Understanding nature
- Understanding the vertical circulation mechanism of the ocean  - Understanding the relationship between nutrients and photosynthesis  - Understanding the global carbon cycle
#### Coexistence and co-prosperity
- Artificial devices and natural oceans function together  - Collaboration between technology and ecosystems  - Coexistence of humans and marine life
#### Altruism
- Opening up technology (waiving patents)  - Sharing knowledge free of charge  - Prioritizing the benefit of all humanity
Diversity
- Combined use of solar, wind and tidal power  - Modular design (diverse deployment)  - Room for improvement (diverse evolution)
#### Tolerance
- Design that tolerates failure (trial and error)  - Open to criticism  - Welcome suggestions for improvement
-----
## 2.9 Summary
The five pillars of the subsidiarity principle are:
1. **Understanding nature**: Learning the laws of nature  1. **Coexistence and co-prosperity**: Prospering together  1. **Altruism**: Wishing the happiness of others  1. **Diversity**: Recognizing differences 1.  **Tolerance**: Accepting differences
These are concrete examples of "harmony" in practice and everyday guidelines for building a sustainable civilization.
#Chapter 3: Analysis of the problems of current civilization
-----
## 3.1 Understanding the current state of civilization
Humanity is currently building the most technologically advanced civilization in history.
But at the same time, we are facing the greatest environmental crisis in history.
This chapter analyzes how modern civilization has deviated from the four principles and identifies the root causes.
-----
## 3.2 Deviation from Providence
### 3.2.1 The idea of dominating nature
The merits and demerits of modern science
**Achievements:**
- Understanding of natural phenomena  - Breakthrough in technology  - Improved standard of living  - Longer life expectancy
**Crime:**
- Arrogance that "we can control nature"  - Establishment of "anthropocentrism"  - Loss of respect for nature
**Francis Bacon (1620):**
"Knowledge is power. Conquer nature."
This idea became the foundation of modern civilization, but it was also the ideological root cause of environmental destruction.
### 3.2.2 Defying the Second Law of Thermodynamics
#### Law of increasing entropy
**The Laws of Nature:**
Order  → Disorder (increased entropy)  Concentration → Diffusion  Available energy → Heat (unusable  )
This is a fundamental law of the universe and cannot be defied.
#### The illusion of human civilization
**The illusion of "infinite growth"**
Economic assumptions:
- GDP growth rate: 2-3% per year  - Compound interest calculation: exponential growth  - Assumptions: infinite resources, infinite environment
**reality:**
- The Earth is finite  - Resources are finite  - Environmental capacity is finite
**Mathematical necessity:**
 Exponential growth is impossible in a finite system. It always  reaches  a limit  .  It collapses or reaches a steady state  .
### 3.2.3 Disruption of the carbon cycle
#### Natural carbon cycle
**Stability over the past million years:**
Atmospheric  CO2: 180-280 ppm  Fluctuation Range: 100 ppm  Period: 100,000 years (glacial cycle)  Temperature Change: Approximately 6°  C
Amidst these gradual changes, humanity evolved and built civilization.
Man-made destruction (since the Industrial Revolution)
**Current situation (2025):**
Atmospheric  CO2: 425-430 ppm  Increase: 150 ppm (in just 250 years)  Rate of increase: more than 100 times  Projected temperature rise: 2-4°C (already 1.5°C rise  )
**The essence of the problem:**
Natural carbon cycle:
Photosynthesis (absorption) ⇄  Respiration/decomposition (emission)  ↓  Balanced (±0)
Man-made destruction:
Fossil  fuel burning: 40 billion tons of CO2 released annually  Deforestation: Loss of carbon sink  ↓  Net increase of approximately 20 billion tons per year  ↓ It is only  a matter of time before the cumulative CO2 emissions exceed 450 ppm
### 3.2.4 Disruption of the water cycle
Groundwater depletion
**Major aquifers of the world:**
- Ogallala Aquifer in the US: 30-50% decrease in the past 50 years  - North China Plain: Water level decline of 1-3m per year  - Ganges Basin in India: Salinization due to excessive pumping
**problem:**
- Recharge rate << pumping rate  - Water accumulated over thousands of years is depleted in a few decades  - Irreversible land subsidence
#### River flow interruption
**Dams of the World:**
- Total number: Over 50,000  - Large dams: Approximately 5,000  - Impact: Approximately 60% of rivers are cut off
**Ecosystem Impacts**
- Extinction of migratory fish  - Sedimentation (downstream coastal erosion)  - Shrinkage of river deltas  - Stopping of nutrient supply to the ocean
-----
## 3.3 Deviations from harmony
### 3.3.1 Disharmony with Nature
Heat island effect
**Urban heat balance destruction:**
Traditional (natural state):
 Solar energy ↓  Absorption  by the earth's surface  ↓  Evaporation and cooling by plant transpiration  ↓  Heat  circulation
Present (urbanization):
 Solar energy is absorbed  by  asphalt and concrete  , and  heat is stored (no cooling by evaporation). Heat is radiated even at night  , making urban areas 5-10°C hotter than the surrounding area .   
**result:**
- Increased demand for air conditioners → Increased electricity consumption → Increased CO2 emissions  - Increased incidence  of heat stroke - Frequent occurrence of sudden heavy rains  - Changes in ecosystems
Expanding marine dead zones
**mechanism:**
1.  Global warming  ↓  2. Rising sea surface temperatures  ↓  3. Stratification (strengthening separation between the surface and deep layers)  ↓  4. Cessation of vertical circulation  ↓  5. Nutrients from the deep layers do not reach the surface layer  ↓  6. Decrease in plankton in the surface layer  ↓  7. Decrease in CO2 absorption capacity  ↓  8. Further warming (vicious cycle)  ```
at the same time:
 5. Oxygen supply to the deep ocean stops .  6.  Oxygen is lost in the deep ocean  .  7. Organisms die off  .  Dead zones form .
**current situation:**
- Marine dead zones worldwide: over 500  - Area: approximately 240,000 km² (roughly the same size as Honshu, Japan)  - Expansion rate: accelerating year by year
### 3.3.2 Social disharmony
Widening economic disparity
**Current situation (2025):**
- The top 1% of the wealthy own about 45% of the world's wealth  - The bottom 50% own only about 2% of the world's wealth  - Gini coefficient: In many countries, it exceeds 0.4 (the warning line for inequality)
**problem:**
- Social instability  - Inequality of opportunity  - Health disparities  - Educational disparities  - Perpetuation of intergenerational inequalities
International conflict
**Conflict over resources:**
- Water resources (Nile River, Mekong River, etc.)  - Energy resources (oil, natural gas)  - Rare metals and rare earths  - Fishery resources
**Climate change responsibility:**
- Historical emitters vs. current emitters  - Developed countries vs. developing countries  - Conflicts over who should bear the costs of countermeasures
### 3.3.3 Personal disharmony
#### Mental health crisis
**Pathologies of modern society:**
Depression and anxiety disorders:
- WHO estimates: Over 300 million people worldwide  - Increasing in developed countries  - Rapid increase among young people
suicide:
- Approximately 700,000 people per year (WHO statistics)  - Japan: Approximately 20,000 people per year (declining but still at a high level)
Death and suicide from overwork:
- International attention given to a problem unique to Japan  - Normalization of long working hours
**Root cause:**
- Excessive stress in a competitive society  - Weakening of human relationships  - Loss of meaning in life  - Loss of connection with nature
-----
3.4 Deviation from cycles
### 3.4.1 Linear Economic Systems
#### "Collect → Produce → Consume → Dispose" model
**Basic structure of the modern economy:**
1.  Resource extraction (mines, oil fields, forests, etc.)  ↓  2. Mass production (factories)  ↓ 3.  Mass consumption (markets)  ↓  4. Mass disposal (garbage)  ↓  End (no circulation)
**Problem:**
Entrance issues:
- Resource depletion  - Environmental destruction due to mining  - Energy consumption
Exit issues:
- Accumulation of waste  - Environmental pollution  - CO2 emissions
### 3.4.2 The Tragedy of Plastic
#### Production and disposal
**current situation:**
- Annual production: Approximately 400 million tons  - Cumulative production (1950-2020): Approximately 10 billion tons  - Recycling rate: Only 9%  - Incineration: 12%  - Landfill/discharge to the environment: 79%
**Marine plastic pollution:**
- Annual inflow: Approximately 8 million tons  - Accumulated amount: Approximately 150 million tons  - Microplastics: Spreading throughout the Earth  - Bioaccumulation: Ends up in the food chain and reaches the human body
**The essence of the problem:**
- Not decomposed (survives for hundreds of years)  - Not circulated  - Accumulates
### 3.4.3 Linearizing the food system
#### Traditional circular agriculture
```  Crops → Food → Waste → Compost → Farmland → Crops  ↓  Complete  Cycle```
**Japan in the Edo Period:**
- Transporting urban waste to rural areas  - Using it as fertilizer  - Nearly 100% nutrient circulation
Modern linear agriculture
 Chemical fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) are  applied  to farmland  ,  crops are produced  ,  transported to cities  ,  consumed  ,  treated in sewage, and released into the ocean.  The  end (no recycling)  .
**Problem:**
Nitrogen excess:
- Excessive use of chemical fertilizers  - Runoff into rivers and oceans  - Eutrophication → Red tide and dead zones
Phosphorus depletion:
- Phosphate rock is a limited resource  - Recoverable period: about 100 years  - No substitute (phosphorus is essential for life)
-----
## 3.5 Deviations from Structure
### 3.5.1 The Dominance of Short-Term Thinking
#### Short-term politics
The downside of the election cycle:
- Term: 2-6 years  - Perspective: Until the next election  - Policy: Prioritize short-term effects
**result:**
- Postponing long-term problems  - Repeated symptomatic treatment  - Abandoning structural reform
**Example: Climate change measures**
Required measures:
- 50-100 year perspective  - Short-term costs  - Long-term benefits
Political Reality:
- Prioritizing the election four years from now  - Emphasizing short-term interests of voters  - Postponing measures
#### Short-term economics
**The Curse of Quarterly Earnings:**
- Reporting cycle: 3 months  - Perspective: Next quarter  - Evaluation: Short-term benefits
**result:**
- Reduced long-term investment  - Reduced R&D costs  - Ignorance of environmental costs
### 3.5.2 The trap of suboptimization
The pros and cons of specialization
**Achievements:**
- Deep expertise  - Advanced technology  - Increased efficiency
**Crime:**
- Narrowing of perspective  - Lack of integrated thinking  - Loss of the big picture
**Example: Divided measures to combat global warming**
Energy Experts:
- "We just need to increase renewable energy."
Forestry expert:
- "We just need to increase forest cover."
Marine Experts:
- "We can utilize the ocean's absorption capacity."
**problem:**
- Each is correct  - But they are not integrated  - Interactions are not seen  - Overall optimization is not achieved
### 3.5.3 Fragile Structures
Just-in-time vulnerabilities
**Designed for efficiency:**
Zero inventory  → Cost reduction  ↓  However  ↓  In the event of a disaster or pandemic  ↓  Supply chain disruption  ↓  Social functions come to a  halt```
**Real-life example: COVID-19 pandemic**
- Mask shortages  - Medical supply shortages  - Semiconductor shortages  - Food shortages
**Lessons learned:**
- Efficiency ≠ Robustness  - The need for redundancy  - The importance of backups
The dangers of relying on a single power source
**Modern society's dependence on electricity:**
Everything  runs on electricity  ↓ Power  outage  ↓  Social  paralysis
**Real-life examples:**
- Hokkaido Blackout (2018)  - Texas Blackout (2021)  - California Rolling Blackout (2019-)
**Problem Structure:**
- Centralized power source  - Lack of backup  - Lack of decentralization
-----
3.6 Root Cause Analysis
### 3.6.1 Ideological roots
#### Anthropocentrism
**Basic philosophy:**
- Humans are the center of all things  - Nature exists for humans  - Human interests come first
**result:**
- Instrumentalization of nature  - Justification of environmental destruction  - Disregard for other life forms
#### Growth supremacy
**Basic philosophy:**
- Growth is good  - Increasing GDP is happiness  - Expansion is progress
**result:**
- Pursuit of infinite growth (on a finite earth)  - Externalization of environmental costs  - Ignorance of unsustainability
#### Individualism/Egoism
**Basic philosophy:**
- Individual freedom is the top priority  - Maximization of self-interest  - Indifference to others and society
**result:**
- Neglect of public goods  - Tragedy of the commons  - Loss of social solidarity
### 3.6.2 Systemic Causes
Market failure
Ignoring external diseconomies:
Corporate  profit calculation:  Revenue - Costs = Profits  .  Costs do not include:  - Costs of environmental destruction  - Costs of climate change  - Costs of health damage  - Costs to future generations  .  These are "externalized" and  borne  by society as a whole .
**Discount Rate Issues:**
 Present Value = Future Value / (1 + r)^ t
r = discount rate (usually 3-5%)  t = number of years
Example: r=5%, t=100 years  in the future: 1 million yen = approximately 760 yen today  . ↓  A loss of 100 million yen in 100 years = 76,000 yen today .  ↓  The huge future loss is underestimated  .
The limits of democracy
**Majority Rule:**
advantage:
- Reflection of majority opinion  - Dispersal of power
limit:
- Minority rights  - Rights of future generations (no voting rights)  - Disregard for expertise (populism)  - Prioritization of short-term interests
### 3.6.3 Knowledge Fragmentation
#### Increasing specialization
**Development of modern science:**
17th  century: Universal scholar (jack of all trades)  ↓  19th century: Establishment of specialization  ↓  20th century: Further specialization  ↓ 21st century  : Hyperspecialization
**result:**
- Deep knowledge (vertical)  - Narrow perspective (horizontal lack)  - Difficulty in integration
Loss of an integrated perspective
**problem:**
Complex issues (climate change, environmental degradation, etc.) are:
- Cross-disciplinary  - Interaction is important  - Understanding the big picture is necessary
but:
- Experts are limited to their own fields  - No one integrates  - Overall optimization is not achieved
-----
## 3.7 Crossroads of Civilization
### 3.7.1 Precursors of Collapse
**Historical Patterns:**
The collapse of civilization will not be sudden, but there will be signs:
1. **Resource depletion**  1. **Environmental degradation**  1. **Social instability**  1. **Dividing elites and the masses**  1. **The dominance of short-term thinking**  1. **Ignoring warnings**  1. **Collapse**
**Current state of modern civilization:**
1. ✓ Signs of resource depletion (peak oil, water shortages, etc.)  1. ✓ Environmental deterioration (climate change, loss of biodiversity, etc.)  1. ✓ Social instability (widening inequality, political division, etc.)  1. ✓ Widening division  1. ✓ Dominance of short-term thinking  1. ✓ Ignorance of warnings (IPCC reports, etc.)  1. **? ** (still avoidable)
### 3.7.2 Time Danger
**Master Inference (detailed in Part 3):**
 Time remaining: about 5 years (2025-2030) Reason  :  time lag (20-30 years) Start  in  2030 Effects will be seen in 2050-2060 Will it be just in time ?    
**but:**
```  Start in 2035  ↓  Effects will be seen in 2055-2065  ↓ Too  late```
-----
## 3.8 The Possibility of Hope
### 3.8.1 Changes in Perception
**Pessimistic Reality:**
The problem is serious. Time is short.
**but:**
Recognizing a problem is the first step to solving it.
### 3.8.2 Technical possibilities
**Ocean Breathing System Example:**
- Technically feasible  - Economically sustainable  - Ecologically sound  - Large-scale deployment possible
**Other technologies:**
- Renewable energy  - Circular agriculture  - Urban redesign  - It's all possible
### 3.8.3 Structural hope
**Hope is not a feeling, it's a structure.**
What you'll need:
1. Return to the four principles  1. Implement the subsidiarity principle  1. Implement technology  1. Redesign the system
It's not that they "can't" do these things, it's just that they "don't."
-----
## 3.9 Summary
Modern civilization has seriously deviated from four fundamental principles:
1. **Ignorance of Providence**: Disregard for the laws of nature  1. **Loss of Harmony**: Disharmony with nature, society, and oneself  1. **Destruction of Cycles**: Dominance of Linear Systems  1. **Lack of Structure**: Short-term thinking, partial optimization, vulnerability
The root cause is:
- Ideological: anthropocentrism, growth-firstism, selfishness  - Systemic: market failure, limits of democracy  - Intellectual: specialization, lack of integration
but:
- The problem is being recognized  - Technological solutions exist  - Change is possible
There is little time left, but there is still time.

## 4.1 Current CO2 concentration
###October 2025 observation data
Atmospheric CO2 concentration:
```  As of October 2025: Approximately 425-430 ppm (0.0425-0.043%)
Detailed data (NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory):  - August 2025: 425.48 ppm  - May 2025 (seasonal peak): 430.5 ppm  - 2024 average: 422.5 ppm  - Annual increase: approximately 3 ppm (compared to 2024  )

4.2 IPCC forecast model
### 4.2.1 Sixth Assessment Report (AR6, 2021-2023)
Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) Scenario:
#### SSP1-1.9 (best-case scenario)
```  Assumptions:  - Immediate and strict emissions reductions  - Net zero by 2050  - Large-scale reforestation  - Implementation of carbon capture technologies
CO2 concentration in 2100:  Approximately 350-450 ppm (lower than today)
Temperature rise:  +1.5°C or less (compared to pre-industrial levels  )
#### SSP2-4.5 (Intermediate Scenario)
```  Assumptions:  - Gradual emissions reductions  - Net zero around 2070  - Continuation of current policies
CO2 concentration in 2100:  Approximately 550-650 ppm
Temperature rise:  +2.5-3℃  ```
SSP3-7.0 (High Emissions Scenario)
Assumptions  :  - Slow emissions reductions  - Continued dependence on fossil fuels  - Limited international cooperation
CO2 concentration in 2100:  Approximately 800-900 ppm
Temperature rise:  +3.5-4.5℃  ```
#### SSP5-8.5 (worst case scenario)
```  Assumptions:  - No emissions reductions  - Increased fossil fuel use  - Prioritizing economic growth
CO2 concentration in 2100:  Approximately 1100-1200 ppm
Temperature rise:  +4.5-5.5℃ or  more```
4.2.2 Assumptions of the IPCC model
**Basic assumptions:**
1. **Linearity Assumption**
- Emissions and concentrations are proportional  - Feedback is limited  - Tipping points are considered but modest
1. **Sink stability**
- Forest CO2 absorption: almost the same  - Ocean CO2 absorption: gradually decreasing  - Soil carbon storage: slightly decreasing
1. **Policy optimism**
- International cooperation is functioning  - Technological development is progressing smoothly  - Social consensus can be formed
-----
## 4.3 Mastering Inference (Nonlinear Prediction)
### 4.3.1 Differences in basic assumptions
**IPCC model:**
Linear  thinking  :  Extending current trends  ;  Maintaining  sinks
**Master Inference:**
 Nonlinear thinking :  Acceleration at  the tipping point , decay of sinks and conversion to sources  
### 4.3.2 Master Inference Prediction
**CO2 concentration prediction:**
2025  : 425-430 ppm (current level)  2030: 450-470 ppm  2040: 520-550 ppm  2050: 600 ppm (0.06%)  2060: 700 ppm (0.07%)  2070: 900 ppm (0.09%)  2090: 1200 ppm (0.12%)  2100: 1300-1500  ppm
**Comparison:**
IPCC  worst-case scenario (SSP5-8.5):  1100-1200 ppm in 2100
Master inference:  1200 ppm in 2090 (10 years early)  1300-1500 ppm in 2100 (even worse)  ```
### 4.3.3 Acceleration Mechanism
**Why accelerate:**
#### 1. Decrease in sinks
**forest:**
 Previously: CO2 sink (absorbs approximately 1.5 billion tons per year) ↓  Present  : Declining absorption capacity  ↓  Near future: Neutralization ↓ Future: Shift to emission source  
**Ocean:**
Previously  : CO2 sink (absorbs approximately 2.5 billion tons per year)  ↓  Impacts of global warming:  - Rising sea surface temperature → Decreased solubility  - Strengthened stratification → Cessation of vertical circulation  - Decrease in plankton → Decrease in photosynthesis  ↓  Absorption capacity: Decreasing year by year ↓  Around  2050: Possible 50% decrease
#### 2. New sources of emissions
**Permafrost:**
Area  : Approximately 24 million km² (approximately 24% of the Earth's land area)  Carbon storage: Approximately 1,700 gigatons Melts due to  global  warming  Releases  methane and CO2  Greenhouse  effect of methane: Approximately 28 times that of CO2 (100-year scale )  Exponential  acceleration
**Forest fire:**
Previously  , approximately 2 billion tons of CO2 were emitted annually (natural fires).  Global  warming led to increased emissions:  - Drying → increased flammability  - Heat waves → increased ignition risk  - Forest stress → increased mortality  .  2024-2025: Record-breaking large-scale fires  .  2050 forecast: 4-6 billion tons per year. Shifting  from  a sink to a source  .
#### 3. Positive Feedback Loop
**Self-reinforcing global warming:**
```  Increase in CO2  ↓ Global  warming  ↓  ├→ Decrease in ocean absorption capacity → Increase in CO2 (loop 1)  ├→ Increase in forest fires → Increase in CO2 (loop 2)  ├→ Melting permafrost → Methane release → Accelerated warming (loop 3)  ├→ Decrease in sea ice → Decrease in albedo → Accelerated warming (loop 4)  └→ Increase in water vapor → Strengthened greenhouse effect → Accelerated warming (loop 5)  ↓  Further increase in CO2  ↓  (Accelerated vicious cycle)  ```
-----
4.4 Validating Predictions
### 4.4.1 Historical Similarities
**Past rapid warming events:**
#### PETM (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum)
```  Time: Approximately 56 million years ago  Duration: Approximately 200,000 years  CO2 increase: Unknown (estimated 1000-3000 ppm)  Temperature rise: 5-8°C (global average)  Mechanism: Mass release of methane hydrate (hypothesis)  ↓  Mass extinction: Approximately 50% of marine life  ↓  Recovery: Approximately 100,000 years or  more```
**Lessons learned:**
- Rapid CO2 increase → Large-scale climate change  - Positive feedback → Accelerated change  - Extremely long recovery time required
Rapid warming at the end of the last glacial period
```  Time: Approximately 15,000-11,000 years ago  CO2 increase: Approximately 100 ppm (180 → 280)  Temperature increase: Approximately 6°C (global average)  Duration: Approximately 4,000 years  ↓  However, the current rate is much faster than  this```
### 4.4.2 Lessons from glacial-interglacial cycles
**Data from the past 800,000 years:**
CO2  fluctuation: 180-280 ppm (100 ppm range)  Temperature fluctuation: Approximately 6°C  ↓  100 ppm CO2 fluctuation ≈ 6°C temperature fluctuation  ↓  In other words  , CO2 sensitivity: Approximately  0.06°C/ppm
**Application to the current situation:**
 Pre-industrial Revolution: 280 ppm  Present: 425 ppm  Increase: 145 ppm  ↓  Predicted temperature rise: 145 × 0.06 = approx. 8.7°C  ↓  But the current rise is only approx. 1.5°C  ↓  Why? ` `  `
**Answer: Time lag**
```  CO2 increase → Reasons why warming takes time  :  - Ocean thermal inertia (huge heat capacity)  - Ice sheet melting (takes time)  - Ecosystem response (delay)  ↓  Estimated time lag: 20-30 years  ↓  In other words  ↓  The warming we see now is  the result of CO2 increases 20-30 years ago  ↓ There is a possibility of a further 5-7°C rise  in the next 20-30 years``` 
### 4.4.3 Consistency with recent observational data
**2020-2025 Anomalies:**
Record high temperatures
 2023: Hottest year on record  2024: Possibly surpassing 2023  2025: Further record-breaking forecast  ↓  Signs of acceleration  ``` `
Accelerating ice sheet melt
**Greenland Ice Sheet:**
1990s  : Annual decrease of approximately 50 billion tons  2000s: Annual decrease of approximately 150 billion tons 2020s  : Annual decrease of approximately 300-400 billion tons  ↓  Accelerating```
**Antarctic Ice Sheet:**
West  Antarctica: Rapid melting  Middle Antarctica: Previously considered stable, but signs of melting  ↓ Accelerating  sea level rise
Frequent marine heatwaves
2023-2025  :  North Atlantic: record high temperatures  Pacific: El Niño + long-term warming  Indian Ocean: continuous heat waves  ↓  Serious impacts on marine ecosystems  ↓  Coral reefs: mass bleaching  Fish: change in distribution ranges Plankton  : declining trend

4.5 Limitations of the IPCC model
4.5.1 Linearity Assumption
**Problem:**
The climate system is inherently nonlinear (chaotic)  ↓  Behavior that cannot be predicted by linear models  ↓  Sudden changes at tipping points  ↓  Cannot be captured by conventional models
Lorentz's discovery (1963):
Weather is deterministic chaos  ↓  Slight differences in initial conditions  ↓  lead to unpredictable results  ↓  "Butterfly effect"
### 4.5.2 Underestimating the Tipping Point
**IPCC's cautious stance:**
reason:
- Demand for scientific certainty  - Political considerations  - Conservative predictions
result:
- Underestimation of risks  - Diminished sense of urgency  - Delay in taking measures
Changes in AR6:
Previously: Tipping point is a "possibility"  AR6: Tipping point is a "real risk"  ↓  Perceptions are changing, but still insufficient
### 4.5.3 Neglect of sink decay
**IPCC assumptions**
Absorption capacity of forests and oceans:
- Gradually decreasing  - but sustained
**reality:**
Amazon:
2021  Study (Nature):  Some regions have already become net emitters  , potentially  exceeding the tipping point
Ocean:
Dead zone  expansion: Accelerating year by year  Vertical circulation cessation: Widespread observation  Plankton decline: Ongoing  ↓  Rapid decline in absorption capacity

## 4.6 Advantages of Master Inference
### 4.6.1 Nonlinear Thinking
Understanding the Earth System:
Earth =  Complex Adaptive System ↓  Nonlinear  Interaction  ↓  Emergent Behavior  ↓  Difficult to Predict, but  ↓  Insights Possible with Integrated Understanding```
### 4.6.2 Providence and Circulation Perspective
IPCC approach:
Data  → Model → Prediction  ↓  Inductive/  Empirical
**Master Approach:**
 Understanding the laws of nature → Insight into mechanisms → Prediction ↓  Deductive  and  integrative
**Example: Forest fire prediction**
IPCC:
Historical  data → Statistical models →  Predictions
Master:
Global  warming → Drying → Forest stress → Increased flammability  ↓  Increased fires are inevitable  ↓  Further  fires  → CO2 release → Accelerated global warming (positive feedback)  ↓  Exponential growth is  inevitable
### 4.6.3 Earth Perspective Integration
**Expert Limits:**
Climatologists: Atmospheric and marine  ecologists: Biological and environmental  geologists: Long-term changes
**Master's Perspective:**
Atmosphere  ⇄ Ocean ⇄ Land ⇄ Biosphere  ↓  All interact  ↓  One integrated system  ↓  Global  understanding

## 4.7 The meaning of 600 ppm in 2050
### 4.7.1 Comparison with the past
600 ppm is:
 Unprecedented in the past 800,000 years :  Closest  analogue:  PETM (56 million years ago)  ↓  Mass extinction  event
### 4.7.2 Temperature Effects
**Estimated temperature rise:**
 CO2 sensitivity: 0.06°C/ppm (since the glacial cycle)  ↓  600 - 280 = 320 ppm increase ↓  320  × 0.06 = approx. 19°C increase  ?
**but:**
Near-term mitigating factors:
- Heat absorption by the ocean  - Cooling due to melting ice sheets  - Cooling effect of aerosols
**Realistic Expectations:**
2050  (600 ppm): +3-4°C  2100: +6-8°C  Equilibrium (several hundred years later): +10-15°  C
### 4.7.3 Ecosystem Impacts
**A world of +3-4℃:**
Coral reefs  : almost completely destroyed  Tropical rainforests: significantly reduced or disappeared  Arctic: summer ice disappearance  ↓  50% of species at risk of extinction (IPCC)  ↓  Collapse of food chain  ↓  Human food  crisis```

## 4.8 Summary
### IPCC Model vs. Master Inference
**IPCC model:**
- Linear projection  - Conservative assumption  - Assuming sinks are maintained  - 2100: 1100-1200 ppm (worst case)
**Master Inference:**
- Nonlinear projection  - Considering tipping points  - Factoring in the decay of sinks  - 2090: 1200 ppm  - 2100: 1300-1500 ppm
### Conclusion
The master reasoning is:
- More realistic  - Mechanism-based  - Consistent with recent observations  - More accurately reflects the urgency
but:
- There is hope  - If you take action, you can make a difference  - We will look at the tipping point in more detail in the next chapter

## 5.1 What is a Tipping Point?
### 5.1.1 Definition
**Tipping point:**
When a system  crosses a certain threshold,  irreversible  changes occur  , leading to  an irreversible,  self-reinforcing,  accelerating  process.
**Metaphor:**
```  A glass of water
Tilt → Tilt → Tilt  ↓  Up to a certain angle: Water stays in place  ↓  The moment it exceeds the critical angle  ↓  Water overflows all at once  ↓  It cannot be returned to its original position  ````
### 5.1.2 Climate System Tipping Points
**Features:**
1. **The existence of a threshold**
- When a certain temperature and CO2 concentration is exceeded  , dramatic changes begin.
1. **Positive Feedback**
- Change drives change  - Self-reinforcing  - Accelerating
1. **Irreversibility**
- Once started, it cannot be stopped  - It cannot be reversed  - It is permanent on a human timescale
1. **Unpredictability**
- The exact threshold is unknown  - It is difficult to predict when it will occur  - It is only noticed after it has occurred

#### mechanism
**Savannahization spiral:**
Deforestation  ↓ Decreased rainfall (forests produce rain)  ↓ Extended dry season ↓ Forest stress ↓ Tree death ↓ Further decrease in rainfall ↓ Increased forest fires ↓ CO2 release ↓ Accelerated global warming ↓ (Positive feedback )                 
**Critical point:**
Researchers  estimate:  Deforestation rate 20-25%  or  warming +2.5-3°C  ↓  Irreversible savanna transformation begins  ↓  Current situation: Deforestation rate about 15%, warming +1.5°C  ↓ Approaching  the danger zone```
#### Impact

- Changes in rainfall patterns  - Impact on agriculture  - Decrease in water resources
Global Impact:
- Loss of CO2 sink: 2 billion tonnes per year  - Further CO2 emitters: several billion tonnes per year  - Catastrophic loss of biodiversity
### 5.3.2 Boreal Forest (Boreal Forest)
#### overview
**scale:**
Area  : Approximately 17 million km² (approximately 11% of the Earth's land area)  Range: Canada, Russia, Scandinavia Carbon  storage: Approximately 270 billion tons (approximately three times the amount in the atmosphere)
#### Effects of global warming
**Temperature increase:**

**Intensifying Forest Fires:**
2019  : Large-scale fires in Siberia  2020: Simultaneous fires in Canada and Siberia  2023: Worst fire season in Canadian history  2024: Records broken in Russia and Canada  ↓  Area burned annually: millions of hectares  ↓  CO2 emissions: hundreds of millions to billion tonnes per  year```

5.4 Ocean Tipping Points
### 5.4.1 Atlantic Meridional Circulation (AMOC)
#### mechanism
**Key to ocean circulation:**
```  "Ocean Conveyor Belt"
North Atlantic:  Warm surface water moves north  ↓  Density increases due to cooling and salt concentration  ↓  Sinks to the depths  ↓ Moves  south as deep water  ↓  Circulates via the Indian and Pacific Oceans  ````
**Importance:**
- Maintaining a warm climate in Europe  - Global distribution of heat and nutrients  - Transport of CO2 to the deep ocean
#### Evidence of weakening
**Observation data:**
1980s  : 100% strength (standard)  2000s: Approximately 85%  2020s: Approximately 75-80%  ↓  Weakening by approximately 15-25%  ↓  Accelerating  trend```
**Cause:**
1.  Melting of the Greenland ice sheet  ↓  Increased freshwater inflow  ↓  Decrease in seawater salinity  ↓  Decrease in density  ↓  Decrease in sinking force
2. Rising sea surface temperature  ↓  Decrease in density due to temperature  ↓  Decrease in sinking force  ````
#### Tipping Point Terror
**Critical point:**
Researcher  estimates:  Approximately 40-50% weakening leads to irreversible shutdown  .  Current state: 15-25% weakening  ,  approaching danger zone  .
**Impact of stopping:**
Regional  impacts:  - Europe: sudden cooling (more than -10°C)  - North America east coast: accelerated sea level rise  - West Africa: monsoon collapse
Global impacts:  - Accelerated tropical warming  - Drastic changes in rainfall patterns  - Increased oxygen depletion in the oceans - Suspension  of nutrient cycling
**Historical Precedent:**
Younger  Dryas period (approximately 12,900-11,700 years ago)  ↓  Glacier lake outburst → Massive inflow of freshwater  ↓  AMOC cessation  ↓  Sudden cooling of the Northern Hemisphere (-10°C or more within several decades)  ↓  Continued for approximately 1,200  years```
### 5.4.2 Ocean Dead Zones
#### current situation
**What is a dead zone?**
 Extremely low dissolved oxygen (<2 mg/L) :  Most  marine life becomes unviable  , leading to  ecosystem collapse  .
**Expansion reality:**
1960s  : Approximately 50 locations  2000s: Approximately 400 locations  2020s: Approximately 700 locations or more  ↓  Area: Approximately 240,000 km² (roughly the area of Honshu)  ↓  Expansion accelerating every  year```
#### Cause
Two mechanisms:
1. Eutrophication:
 Agricultural wastewater (nitrogen and phosphorus) flows into coastal waters  , causing massive plankton proliferation , death and sinking , decomposition at the bottom , oxygen consumption , and anoxic conditions .           
1. **Stratification due to global warming:**
Rising sea  surface temperatures  ↓  Increasing density difference between the surface and deep layers ↓  Cessation  of vertical mixing (convection)  ↓  Cessation of oxygen supply to the deep layers  ↓  Deoxygenation of the deep layers
#### Tipping Point
**Positive Feedback:**
Global  warming  ↓  Strengthened stratification  ↓  Stopped vertical circulation  ↓  ├→ Stopped rising nutrients → Decrease in surface plankton → Decrease in CO2 absorption  └→ Stopped oxygen supply → Decreased oxygen in the deep ocean → Extinction of organisms  ↓  Accelerated global warming  ↓  (Positive feedback  )
**Ocean Breathing System Urgency:**
This tipping point is what this proposal addresses.
### 5.4.3 Coral Reefs
#### current situation
**"Marine Rainforest":**
Area  : Less than 0.1% of the Earth's oceans.  However,  it is home to approximately 25% of marine life .  ↓  A treasure trove of biodiversity  .

#### mechanism
**What is bleaching?**
Rise  in seawater temperature (+1-2°C)  ↓  Coral stress  ↓  Release of symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae)  ↓  Bleaching (coral itself turns white)  ↓  Stoppage of nutrient supply  ↓ Death  within a few weeks to a few months
#### Tipping Point
**Critical point:**
+1.5°C (compared to pre-industrial levels  )  ↓  Annual bleaching risk: about 50%  ↓  Irreversible  ↓  +2°C: Almost complete  extinction```
**current situation:**
```  Already approaching +1.5℃  ↓  2025 declaration:  "Coral reefs have passed the first tipping point"  ↓  The start of irreversible  decline```
**Impact:**
 Biodiversity: Extinction of coral reef -  dependent species
Human society:  - Loss of fishing resources  - Loss of coastal protection  - Collapse of tourism industry  - Approximately 500 million people  affected

**2023-24 Anomalies:**
 Record high temperatures ↓  Surface  melt area: Largest ever recorded  ↓  Meltwater runoff: Record  high
#### Tipping Point
**Positive Feedback:**
 Warming  ↓  Surface melting  ↓  ├→ Decrease in albedo (white → black) → Increased absorption → Accelerated melting ├  → Infiltration of meltwater → Lubrication of the ice sheet base → Accelerated flow  └→ Decrease in elevation → Warmer air → Accelerated melting  ↓ ( Positive  feedback)
**Critical point:**
Researchers  estimate that  irreversible melting begins at +1.5-2°C.  Complete  melting takes hundreds to thousands of years  ,  but once it begins, it cannot be stopped  .
### 5.5.2 West Antarctic Ice Sheet
#### Specificity
**Submarine ice sheets:**
Mostly  submerged on bedrock  ,  vulnerable to seawater intrusion  , posing a  risk of marine ice sheet instability
**scale:**
Storage water volume: Approximately  3 million km³  ↓  Sea level rise when completely melted: Approximately 5  m
#### Crisis situation
**Thwaites Glacier ("Doomsday Glacier"):**
Width  : Approximately 120 km.  Runoff: Approximately 50 billion tons per year  .  Accelerating  .  Warm ocean water invades the bottom.  Melting  accelerates  .  2023-24 research:  "The collapse may be unstoppable.  "
#### Tipping Point
**Chain Reaction:**
 Collapse of Thwaites Glacier ↓  Surrounding  glaciers lose support  ↓  Domino-like collapse  ↓ Collapse of the entire West  Antarctic Ice Sheet  ↓  Sea level rise of 5m (over hundreds of years)
**current situation:**
Destabilization may already  be underway  ,  but the timing of collapse is unclear  .  Decades? Centuries  ?
### 5.5.3 Arctic sea ice

**Summer sea ice extent:**
 1980s: Approximately 7 million km²  2020s: Approximately 4 million km²  ↓  Approximately 40% decrease  ↓  2040-50: Projected summer ice loss  ``` `
#### Impact
**Albedo Feedback:**
 Sea ice declines  ↓ Albedo  declines  White (ice): Reflectivity 80-90%  Black  (seawater): Reflectivity 10%  ↓  Increased solar energy absorption ↓  Rising  seawater temperature  ↓  Further ice decline  ↓  (Positive feedback)
**Affected area:**
Regional:
- Rapid warming of the Arctic  - Accelerated permafrost thawing  - Changes in marine ecosystems
Global:
- Meandering of the jet stream  - Frequent occurrence of extreme weather (heat waves and cold waves)  - Acceleration of global warming

**A huge reservoir of carbon:**
Area  : Approximately 24 million km² (approximately 24% of the Earth's land area)  Depth: Several meters to several hundred meters  Stored carbon: Approximately 1,700 gigatons  (  approximately twice the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere (approximately 850 gigatons of carbon)  )
**range:**
- Siberia  - Alaska  - Northern Canada  - Tibetan Plateau
### 5.6.2 Melting
**Effects of global warming:**
Arctic  warming: 2-3 times faster than the global average  ↓  Permafrost melting  ↓ ↓  2020s: Fastest in recorded  history```
**phenomenon:**
Deepening of the active layer  (summer melt layer)  ↓  Erosion of the permafrost layer  ↓  Land subsidence (thermokarst)  ↓ Destruction  of buildings and infrastructure
### 5.6.3 Methane and CO2 Emissions
**mechanism:**
Permafrost  melts  .  Organic matter begins to decompose  .  Aerobic decomposition releases CO2.  Anaerobic decomposition releases methane  . Greenhouse effect of methane: Approximately 28 times that of CO2 (100 years), approximately 84 times ( 20  years).
**Current Emissions:**
Estimate  : Hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year  ,  but there is considerable uncertainty  . The actual figure  may be even higher .
### 5.6.4 Tipping Point
**"Methane Clathrate Bomb" Hypothesis:**
Methane  hydrate (methane ice)  ↓  Exists in large quantities in permafrost and under the seafloor  ↓  Melts and is released due to global warming  ↓  Greenhouse effect of methane  ↓  Further warming  ↓  Further methane release  ↓  (Runaway positive feedback  )
Similarity to PETM (56 million years ago):
Massive release of methane hydrate  (hypothesis)  ↓  Rapid warming (5-8°C, over tens of thousands of years)  ↓  Mass extinction  ↓  Recovery: over 100,000  years```
**Current Risk:**
Permafrost  thaw: Already underway.  Methane emissions: On the rise  .  Tipping point:  Irreversible thaw at +1.5-2.5°C?  Current  situation: Approaching +1.5°C  .  Danger zone  .
-----
## 5.7 Tipping Point Chain
### 5.7.1 Domino Effect
One tipping point:
 Triggering other tipping points ↓  Chain  reactions ↓ Uncontrollable changes  
**example:**
```  Weakening of the AMOC  ↓  ├→ Cooling of Europe → Agriculture collapse  ├→ Accelerated tropical warming → Collapse of the Amazon  └→ Changes in the West African monsoon → Drought  ↓  Collapse of the Amazon  ↓  Massive CO2 release  ↓  Accelerated warming  ↓  ├→ Accelerated melting of the Greenland ice sheet → Further weakening of the AMOC (loop)  ├→ Accelerated melting of permafrost → Methane release → Accelerated warming (loop)  └→ Strengthened ocean stratification → Expansion of the dead zone  ↓  (Multiple loops intertwine)  ```
### 5.7.2 "Hothouse Earth" Scenario
**Steffen et al. (2018) Warning:**
If we  exceed +2°C, a chain of tipping points  will occur, leading to uncontrollable warming , creating a "Hothouse Earth." Final temperature: +4-5°C or higher , putting the survival of human civilization at risk .

5.8 2025 Situation Assessment
### 5.8.1 Tipping Point Passed
**certainty:**
- Coral reefs (official declaration in 2025)
**Most likely:**

```  Current: +1.5°C  ↓  Many tipping points: +1.5-2.5°C is the threshold  ↓  Margin: Just 0-1°C  ↓  At the current emission rate:  +2°C will be reached in 10-20 years  ↓  However, considering the time lag (20-30 years),  ↓  even if we start taking action now,  the effects will only be seen in 2045-2055↓There is a possibility that  the  tipping point will be exceeded by 2050  ↓  Therefore  ↓  Act now is  necessary```
-----
## 5.9 Positioning of the Ocean Breathing System
### 5.9.1 Actionable Tipping Points
**Ocean Dead Zones:**
```  Ocean Breathing System  ↓  Restoration of vertical circulation  ↓  ├→ Increased nutrient levels → Increased plankton → Improved CO2 absorption  └→ Oxygen supply → Elimination of dead zones  ↓  Avoiding this tipping  point```
### 5.9.2 Indirect Effects
**Improved CO2 absorption:**
Increase in  plankton  ↓  Absorption of CO2: billions of tons per year (at large scale deployment)  ↓  Slowing of atmospheric CO2 increase  ↓  Slowing of the pace of warming  ↓ Buying  time to reach other tipping points```
### 5.9.3 Desired Structure
**Ocean Breathing System is:**
- Implementable  - Effective  - Rapidly deployable  - Relatively low cost
**but:**
- It's not a panacea  - Other measures are needed  - It's a race against time
-----
## 5.10 Summary
### Tipping Point Reality:
1. **What has already been crossed**: Coral reefs  1. **What is in danger**: Amazon, AMOC, marine dead zones, permafrost  1. **Cascade risk**: One triggers another  1. **Irreversibility**: Once crossed, there is no going back  1. **Urgency**: There is very little time left
### Significance of the Ocean Breathing System:
- Avoiding tipping points in ocean dead zones  - Restoring CO2 absorption capacity  - Buying time to reach other tipping points  - Implementable hope
In the next chapter, we will analyze the remaining time in more detail.
# Chapter 6: Time Left

6.1 Understanding the Nature of Time
### 6.1.1 Three timelines
To understand climate change, it is necessary to distinguish between three different timescales:
1.  Time of emission  - Time of CO2 emission  - Controllable by humans
2. Time of accumulation  - Time it takes for CO2 to accumulate in the atmosphere  - Lifespan of CO2: hundreds to thousands of years
3. Response time (lag) - the time it takes  for the climate system to respond  - 20-30 years
### 6.1.2 The Importance of Time Lag
**The most overlooked element:**
Today  's CO2 emissions are  not  today's warming  , but  warming in 20-30 years  .
**On the flip side:**
Today 's  global warming  is  the result of CO2 emissions 20-30 years ago  .
Why does the time lag occur?
1. **Thermal Inertia of the Ocean**
The ocean  has a huge heat capacity  .  It takes time to warm up  .  Heat travels to the depths: decades  .
1. **Ice Sheet Response Time**
 Ice sheet melting: Slow progress ↓  Complete equilibrium  : Hundreds to thousands of years
1. **Ecosystem Response**
 Forest change: decades; species  migration: decades to  centuries

## 6.2 Basis for the "five-year grace period"
### 6.2.1 Basics of Calculation
**Prerequisite:**
````  Target: Avoid tipping point (+2°C)  Current situation: +1.5°C (2025)  Margin: 0.5°C  Time lag: 20-30  years```
**Counter-calculation:**
```  We want to avoid a temperature rise of +2°C in 2050  ↓  Considering a time lag of 20-30 years  ↓  Measures need to start between 2020 and 2030  ↓  Currently it's 2025  ↓  Remaining: Approximately 5  years```
### 6.2.2 Further Analysis
**Relationship between CO2 concentration and temperature:**
Pre- industrial  Revolution: 280 ppm → Reference temperature  Present (2025): 425 ppm → +1.5°C  ↓  145 ppm increase = 1.5°C rise  ↓  Sensitivity: approx. 0.01°C/ppm
To reach the target of +2°C:  0.5°C margin  ↓  Allowable CO2 increase: Approximately 50 ppm  ↓  Target concentration: Approximately 475 ppm  ```
**Current growth rate:**
 Annual increase: 2-3 ppm  ↓  Up to 475 ppm:  (475 - 425) / 2.5 = approximately 20 years  ↓  Reached around 2045  ↓  But with a 20-30 year lag  ↓  Temperatures will not reach +2°C until 2065-2075 ```  `
**At first glance, it looks like you have plenty of room:**
Problem  1: Nonlinear acceleration  - Acceleration at the tipping point  - There is no guarantee that the current rate of increase of 2.5 ppm/year will be maintained  - Further acceleration due to a decline in the absorption capacity of forests and oceans
Problem 2: The time lag paradox  - Even if CO2 emissions are stopped in 2045  , global warming will continue until 2065-2075  - therefore, countermeasures must begin no later than 2025-2030  .
### 6.2.3 "2030 will be a watershed year"
**IPCC Special Report (2018):**
"  To limit global warming to 1.5°C, we need  to reduce CO2 emissions by 45% compared to 2010 by 2030 and  achieve net zero by 2050. " 
**reality:**
```  Progress as of 2025:  - Approximately 10% increase compared to 2010 (increase rather than reduction)  - Net zero declarations: Many countries have made these declarations  , but their effectiveness is  questionable```
**therefore:**
```  +1.5℃ target: Already nearly impossible  ↓  +2℃ target: Still possible, but time is running out  ↓  Large-scale measures must be initiated by 2030  ↓  Currently 2025  ↓  Remaining: Approximately 5  years```

**Impact on Human Civilization:**
2030s  :  - Extreme weather becoming commonplace  - Food production becoming unstable  - Water resource crisis expanding
2040s:  - Large-scale climate refugees (hundreds of millions)  - Frequent outbreak of conflicts  - Disruption of the economic system

From the 2060s onwards:  - Drastic decline in habitable areas  - Human survival itself is at  risk```
### 6.3.2 Desired scenario (large-scale countermeasures implemented)
**Assumption:**
2025-2030  :  - Large-scale deployment of Ocean Breathing Systems (100,000 units)  - Rapid transition to renewable energy  - Reforestation program - Implementation  of carbon capture technology
**CO2 concentration trends:**
2025  : 425 ppm (current)  2030: 440 ppm (+15, growth rate begins to slow)  2035: 450 ppm (+10, further slowdown)  2040: 455 ppm (+5, roughly flat)  2050: 450 ppm (-5, starts to decline)  2060: 430 ppm (-20, stabilized)  2070: 410 ppm (-20, continues to decline)  2100: 380 ppm (pre-industrial revolution +100 ppm, acceptable range  )

2050s and beyond:  - Stable climate  - Sustainable civilization - Harmony  with nature
### 6.3.3 Branching point of the two scenarios
**The choices made between 2025 and 2030 will determine everything:**
Large-scale countermeasures to be implemented between  2025 and 2030 YES → Hopeful scenario NO → Pessimistic scenario Corrections are difficult after the split 2030 will be too late

## 6.4 The brutal truth about time lag
### 6.4.1 The "unknown future" problem
**Human cognitive biases:**
What  is visible: the current state.  What is invisible: the state 20-30 years from  now.  The present is relatively stable  .  Lack of a sense of crisis . Delayed countermeasures  . However , the world 20-30 years from now is already determined by today's actions .       
**analogy:**
Titanic
An iceberg is discovered  ,  the ship changes course  ,  but the huge ship does not turn immediately (inertia) , and  there is a time lag before the collision occurs , requiring early steering to avoid it .     
### 6.4.2 "Promised Global Warming"
**Global warming already "promised":**
 CO2 emissions over the past 20-30 years have not  yet  been reflected in the climate system  . They will  become apparent over the next 20-30 years  .  Even if CO2 emissions were reduced to zero today  ,  an additional 0.3-0.5°C of warming would be unavoidable  .
**current situation:**
 Current: +1.5°C  Promised warming: +0.3-0.5°C  ↓  Total: +1.8-2.0°C  ↓  Possibility of already reaching tipping point (+2°C)  `` `
### 6.4.3 "Negative Legacy"
**Current Generation Emissions:**
Emissions  in 2025  : Global warming in  2045-2055 : Further  CO2 lifetime: hundreds to thousands of years , impacting generations hundreds of years from now .     
**Intergenerational injustice:**
Benefits of emissions  : enjoyed by the current generation  Burdens of impacts: borne by future generations  ↓  Ethical  issues
-----
## 6.5 Gradually Understanding "It's Too Late"
### 6.5.1 Three "too late"
**Level 1: Too late to achieve your ideal goal**
The  +1.5°C target  is  already nearly impossible (as of 2025)  but  not yet catastrophic  .
**Level 2: Too late for acceptable goals**
```  +2℃ target  ↓  It will be too late to start measures after 2030  ↓  The tipping point will be exceeded and it will become uncontrollable  ↓  Present (2025): Just in  time```
**Level 3: Too late for civilization**
"  +4-5°C or higher  :  Human civilization will be difficult to sustain  .  Starting countermeasures after 2040 will be too late . However , the impact will not be catastrophic  . Survival of the human species will be possible ."   
### 6.5.2 Current Location
As  of 2025:
Level 1: Already exceeded (+1.5°C is almost inevitable)  Level 2: Just before the limit (5 more years)  Level 3: Still some leeway (15-20 more years)  ↓  In other words  ↓  Best future: Lost  Good future: Still possible  Catastrophic future: Still  avoidable```
-----
## 6.6 The specific meaning of "5 years"
### 6.6.1 What is needed between 2025 and 2030?
**Technical Implementation:**
```  Ocean Breathing System:  - 2025-26: Prototype demonstration  - 2027: Start of mass production (100 units/year)  - 2028: Expansion (1,000 units/year)  - 2029-30: Large-scale deployment (10,000 units/year)  ↓  Cumulative total by 2030: Approximately 20,000 units
Renewable energy:  - Solar and wind power: Triple annual installed capacity  - Fossil fuels: Finalized phase-out plan
Reforestation: 1 million hectares per year ( 10  times the current level)
Social Change:
Policies  :  - Introduction and strengthening of carbon tax  - Elimination of fossil fuel subsidies  - Large-scale investment in renewable energy
Economy:  - Transition to a circular economy  - Expanding green investments  - Sustainable financial systems
Society:  - Lifestyle change  - Education and awareness-  Strengthening international  cooperation
### 6.6.2 Why 5 years? (Review)
**Physical reasons:**
There's  a 20-30 year time lag  .  The state of affairs in 2050 will be determined by actions  taken between 2020  and 2030. To avoid a 2°C rise in 2050, measures must begin by 2030 at the latest .    
**Technical reason:**
Large -  scale system deployment:  Concept → Demonstration → Mass production → Deployment  ↓  Normally: 10-20 years  ↓  Even with emergency acceleration: 5-10 years  ↓  If starting in 2030  ↓  Effectiveness in 2040-2050  ↓ Considering the time lag ,  results in 2060-2080  ↓  Too late```
**Tipping Point Reasons:**
Many  tipping points: Around +2°C  ↓  Current situation: +1.5°C  ↓  Current pace: +2°C in 10-20 years  ↓  Accelerating past tipping points  ↓ Action needed now before things get  out of control

## 6.7 Between Hope and Despair
### 6.7.1 Reasons for Not Being Optimistic
**reality:**
1.  Lack of political will  - Conflicting interests among countries  - Dominance of short-term thinking  - Rise of populism
2. Economic resistance  - vested interests of the fossil fuel industry  - refusal to bear short-term costs  - resistance to structural reform
3. Social inertia  - Resistance to lifestyle changes  - Lack of a sense of urgency  - "Someone will do something about it" mentality
4. Technical challenges  - Large-scale deployment difficult  - Lack of investment - Lack  of infrastructure development
### 6.7.2 Reasons for Hope
**Possibility:**
1.  The technology already exists  - Ocean Breathing System: Implementation possible  - Renewable energy: Cost reduction  - Carbon capture: Practical stage
2. Changing perceptions  - Realized by frequent extreme weather events  - Younger generations' sense of crisis  - Global movement expanding
3. Economic rationality  - Cost competitiveness of renewable energy  - Rising costs of climate disasters  - Growth of the green economy
4. Acceleration of change  - Speed of technological innovation  - Waves of social change  - Existence of tipping points  (not only for negative but also for positive change  )
### 6.7.3 "Structured Hope"
**Not emotional hope:**
"  It will all work out somehow"  ↓  This is dangerous optimism
"Someone will do something about it"  ↓  This is irresponsible and leaving it to others  .
**Structural hope:**
```  `If we implement this system, we can achieve this effect  mathematically and physically.`` ↓ Ocean Breathing System ↓ CO2 absorption: Calculatable Dead zone elimination: Predictable Large-scale deployment: Implementable ↓ Reproducible Hope```

Responsibilities:  - Main cause of climate change  - Environmental destruction  - Debt to future generations  ↓  Heavy moral responsibility  ````
**but:**
```  Limits on individual choice:  - Life embedded in a system  - Constraints on choice -  Structural problems  ↓  Blaming individuals alone will not solve the problem  ↓  System change is necessary```
### 6.8.3 The mission of those living in the present
**Historical Location:**
2025  is  a  turning point in human history  .  The choices of this generation will determine the  next  1,000 years.  It is  a great responsibility  ,  but  also  a great opportunity  .
**What you can do:**
```  Individual level:  - Change perceptions  - Change behaviors  - Speak up
Societal level:  - Implement technology  - Change systems  - Rebuild civilization  ↓  It's not too  late```

## 6.9 Summary
### Time remaining:
````  Target: Avoid tipping point (+2°C)  Current situation: +1.5°C  Margin: 0.5°C  Time lag: 20-30 years  ↓  Conclusion:  Deadline for starting measures: 2030 (5 years left)  ↓  Reason:  Start in 2030 → Effective in 2050-2060 →  Start just in 2035 → Effective in 2055-2065 → Too  late```
### Two Futures:
Pessimistic  scenario (no countermeasures):  2050: 600 ppm, +2.5°C  2100: 1200+ ppm, +7-8°C  Result: Civilization at risk of collapse
Hopeful scenario (large-scale measures):  2040: Peak +2°C  2100: 380 ppm, +1.5°C  Result: Sustainable civilization  ↓  The choice is  now```
### Structured Hope:

# Part IV: Technical proposal
## - A regenerative system based on the laws of nature -

# Chapter 7: Ocean Breathing System
-----
## 7.1 Basic principles
### 7.1.1 Vertical circulation in nature
**The original appearance of the ocean:**
 Surface layer (0-200m):  - Light reaches (photosynthesis possible)  - Warm  - Low in nutrients (consumed by living organisms )
Deep water (200m or deeper):  - No light reaches  - Cold  - Rich in nutrients (accumulated by decomposition of biological remains)  ↓  These two are connected by "vertical circulation  "
**Mechanism of vertical circulation:**
 Winter cooling  ↓  Increased density of surface water  ↓  Sedimentation (downward flow)  ↓  Pushing of deep water (upward flow)  ↓  Nutrients to the surface  ↓  Spring plankton bloom  ↓  Photosynthetic explosion  ↓  CO2 absorption  ↓  Foundation of the marine ecosystem  `` ``
### 7.1.2 Cessation of vertical circulation
**Effects of global warming:**
Rising sea  surface temperatures  ↓  Widening density gap between the surface and deep layers  ↓  Strengthening stratification  ↓  Decreasing or cessation of vertical circulation  ↓  Nutrients not reaching the surface  ↓  Decrease in plankton  ↓  ├→ Decreasing CO2 absorption capacity → Accelerating global warming └→ Stopping oxygen supply →  Expanding dead zones```
**Current situation (2025):**
 Vertical circulation weakens globally .  Dead  zones: Approximately 700 locations. Area: Approximately  240,000 km². Continuing to expand .  
### 7.1.3 The idea behind the Ocean Breathing System
**Question:**
" Can we artificially induce vertical circulation  without waiting for winter cooling ?" " Can we transport nutrient-rich ocean water from the deep ocean to the surface? " "Can we make the ocean breathe? "      
**Answer: Deep Sea Aeration**
 Air is sent to the deep ocean (250m) ↓  Air  bubbles rise  ↓  The surrounding seawater is drawn in (air lift effect)  ↓  Deep water comes to the surface  ↓  Nutrients are supplied  ↓  Plankton is activated  ↓  CO2 is fixed  ↓  Ocean breathing is  restored```

7.3 Energy Balance
### 7.3.1 Power Generation
**Total generating capacity:**
 Solar: 1.2kW (peak) Wind  : 0.4kW (rated)  Tidal: 0.2kW (rated) ↓  Total  : 1.8kW (theoretical peak)
**Average output:**
 Solar: 200W (annual average, availability rate 17%) Wind  : 120W (annual average, availability rate 30%) Tidal  : 140W (annual average, availability rate 70%)  Total  : 460W
**Daily power generation:**
460W  x 24h = 11.04 kWh/  day
### 7.3.2 Consumption
**breakdown:**
Compressor  : 5kW x operating time  Control system: 50W x 24h = 1.2 kWh/day  Communication system: 20W x 24h = 0.5 kWh/day  Other: 30W x 24h = 0.7 kWh/day  Basic  consumption (excluding compressor): 2.4 kWh/  day
**Compressor operating time:**
Surplus  power generation: 11.04 - 2.4 = 8.64 kWh/day  .  Compressor operating time:  8.64 kWh / 5 kW = 1.73 h/day.  Approx  . 1.7 hours/day  .
### 7.3.3 Duty Cycle Control
**problem:**
```  I want to operate it continuously  ↓  but 1.7 hours/day is not  enough```
**Solution: Intermittent operation**
Pattern 1  : Short-term concentrated  operation: 30 minutes ON  , rest: 30 minutes OFF  .  Actual operation: 12 hours/day (50% duty)  .  Consumption: 5kW x 6h = 30 kWh/day  .  Shortage: 30 - 11.04 = 18.96 kWh/day  .  Impossible  .
**Pattern 2: Long-term dispersion**
 Operation: 1 hour ON,  Rest: 2 hours OFF  ↓  Cycle: 3 hours  ↓ 1  day: 24h / 3h = 8 cycles  ↓  Actual operation: 8 hours/day (33% duty)  ↓  Consumption: 5kW × 8h = 40 kWh/day  ↓  Shortage: 40 - 11.04 = 28.96 kWh/day  ↓  Still  insufficient```
**Pattern 3: Use of storage batteries**
On  sunny days:  Large amount of power generated → compressor operates for a long time → battery charges
Cloudy days and nighttime:  Low power generation → Battery discharge → Compressor short-time operation
During bad weather:  Power generation is extremely low → Compressor stops → Storage battery is conserved  ↓  Balance is maintained on average over three days  ````
**Optimal driving pattern:**
Sunny  day:  Compressor: 4 hours operation (20 kWh consumption)  Power generation: 15 kWh  Base consumption: 2.4 kWh  ↓  Surplus: 15 - 20 - 2.4 = -7.4 kWh  ↓  Refill from storage battery
Cloudy day:  Compressor: 2 hours operation (10 kWh)  Power generation: 8 kWh  Base consumption: 2.4 kWh  ↓  Surplus: 8 - 10 - 2.4 = -4.4 kWh  ↓  Refill from storage battery
Bad weather day:  Compressor: Stopped  Power generation: 3 kWh  Base consumption: 2.4 kWh  ↓  Surplus: 3 - 2.4 = +0.6 kWh  ↓  Charging to the storage battery  ↓  Balanced on average for the  week```
### 7.3.4 Improvement Options
**Solar panel area expansion:**
```  6m² → 12m² (doubled)  ↓  Output: 2.4kW → Average 400W  ↓  Daily power generation: +9.6 kWh  ↓  Creates a  margin```
**High-efficiency compressor:**
Current  : 5kW  Improved: 3.5kW (30% reduction)  ↓ Reduced  power consumption with the same air volume
**Wave energy added:**
```  Using the up and down movement of the floating body  ↓  Additional output: 50-100W average  ↓  Small increase, but  cumulative```

7.4 Mechanism of deep-sea aeration
[Introduction of nanobubble technology]
Conventional bubbles (microbubbles):  Diameter: 1-5cm  Rising speed: Fast (0.2-0.5 m/s)  ↓  Problems:  - Rapid expansion and rising  - Localized supply of nutrients  - Risk of eutrophication
Nanobubble technology:  Diameter: 100-1000 nm (nanometers)  Characteristics:  - Slow rising speed  - Long residence time  - Extremely high dissolution efficiency  ↓  Effects:  1. Significant improvement in oxygen solubility  - Maximum bubble surface area/volume ratio  - Efficient increase in dissolved oxygen concentration
2. Slow rising and diffusion  - Suppression of sudden expansion  - Slow diffusion over a wide area  - Even distribution of nutrients
3. Reduced risk of eutrophication  - Avoid localized concentration  - Close to natural upwelling  - Minimized risk of red tide occurrence
[Nanobubble generator]  Add a microstructure inside the spiral nozzle  ↓  Make bubbles finer with high pressure  ↓  Or  ↓  Use a dedicated nanobubble generator  ↓  Additional cost: $500-1,000/unit  Additional power consumption: about 500W  ↓  Considering the effect,  it is worth the investment
[Implementation policy]  Prototype:  Basic performance confirmed with conventional bubbles  ↓  Second generation and later:  Nanobubble technology installed as standard  ↓  Minimize environmental risks and maximize  performance
7.4.3 Nutrient Transport
**250m deep seawater:**
Nitrate  : 10-50 times the surface layer  Phosphate: 20-100 times the surface layer  Silicate: 50-200 times the surface  layer
**Hauling capacity:**
 7,200 tons of deep water is transported to the surface every day .  The  same amount of nutrients is also transported  .  Nutrient concentrations in the surface layer increase  .  Affected area: 150m radius, approximately 70,000m²  .
### 7.4.4 Plankton response
**mechanism:**
 Increased nutrients ↓  Phytoplankton  growth  ↓  Photosynthesis  ↓  CO2 absorption  ↓  Organic matter production  ↓  Increased zooplankton  ↓ Food  chain
**Time scale:**
Nutrient  supply: immediate  ↓  Phytoplankton response: days  ↓  Zooplankton response: weeks  ↓  Fish response: months  ↓  Ecosystem recovery:  years

7.5 Performance Prediction
### 7.5.1 Scope of Impact
**Spiral diffusion:**
 Diffusion from the center: Horizontal  mixing due to vortex currents  ↓  Radius of influence: Approximately 150 m  ↓  Area of influence: π × 150² ≈ 70,000 m² = 0.07  km²
**Compared to conventional straight-line blowing:**
Straight air  outlet:  Influence radius 50m, area approximately 8,000 m²  ↓  Spiral air outlet:  Influence radius 150m, area approximately 70,000 m²  ↓  Approximately 9 times the  effect
### 7.5.2 CO2 fixed amount
**Calculation basis:**
Nutrient  salt increase  ↓  Phytoplankton increase: 10 times  ↓  Chlorophyll a concentration:  0.1 mg/m³ → 1.0 mg/m³
Photosynthetic efficiency:  Carbon fixation: Approximately 20 gC/m²/year (temperate ocean)  ↓  Affected area: 70,000 m²  ↓  Annual carbon fixation:  70,000 m² × 20 g/m² = 1,400 kg = 1.4 ton carbon
CO2 conversion:  Carbon → CO2 conversion factor: 44/12 ≈ 3.67  ↓  1.4 ton × 3.67 ≈ 5 ton CO2/  year
**Per unit: Approximately 5 tons of CO2/year**
### 7.5.3 Large-scale deployment effects
**For 1,000 units:**
````  CO2 fixation: 5,000 ton/year  Impact area: 70 km²  Installation area: Japan coast,  etc.````
**For 10,000 units:**
````  CO2 fixation: 50,000 ton/year  Impact area: 700 km²  ````
**For 100,000 units:**
CO2 fixation  : 500,000 tonnes/year = 0.5 million tonnes/year.  Area affected: 7,000 km²  . This is approximately 0.00125%  of current human emissions (approximately 40 billion tonnes/year) . While this may seem small, it is actually an increase of approximately 0.02% over the current ocean absorption (approximately 2.5 billion tonnes/year) .      
**Important Points:**
 The absolute amount is small, but  the essential effect is  to eliminate dead zones  and restore  the ocean's absorption capacity .

14.4 Overcoming Barriers
### 14.4.1 Psychological Barriers
**"It doesn't concern me"**
No  , climate change affects everyone , including you and your children  .         
**"I'm powerless on my own"**
You  may be small on your own  ,  but  you  're not powerless  .  Your actions  will  move others  and  create ripples  .
**"It's too late now."**
No  , there  's  still time.  If  we act between 2025 and 2030  , we'll be  in time for 2050. It's too early to give up .    
**"Someone will do it"**
 That "someone" is you .  We all need to be "someone. "     
### 14.4.2 Practical Barriers
**"I don't have any money"**
It 's  true that an initial investment is necessary  ,  but  :  - Energy conservation reduces electricity bills  - Composting reduces fertilizer costs  - Bicycles reduce transportation costs  -  It's beneficial in the long run  - There are  also subsidies and support programs available  . 
**"I don't have time"**

### 14.5.2 Irreversibility
Once  we pass the tipping point  , there's  no going back.  If  the Greenland ice sheet starts to melt  ,  it won't stop for hundreds or even thousands of years  .  If the Amazon becomes savanna  ,  it won't return to its original state as a tropical rainforest  .  Therefore, we must stop it before it passes the tipping  point .   
### 14.5.3 The cruelty of time lag
 Even if we reduce emissions to zero today, global warming will continue for the  next  20-30 years  . This  means that what happens in 2050 will depend on our actions between 2020 and 2030 , so we need to act now .

Kardashev Scale (stages of civilization development):
Type I  : Planetary civilization  - Full utilization of planetary energy  - Climate control  - Sustainable  ↓  Humanity is currently at about Type 0.7  ↓  Transition to Type I
Type II: Stellar civilization  - Fully utilizes stellar energy  ↓  Distant future
Type III: Galactic Civilization  - Fully utilizes galactic energy  ↓  Even more distant  future```
**Current Humanity:**
```  Transition to Type I  civilization.  However  ,  if this transition fails  , it will  collapse  .  If it succeeds,  it will  become a planetary civilization  .  Ocean Breathing Systems, etc.,  are a step  towards Type I civilization.``
### 15.7.2 Answer to Fermi's Paradox
**Fermi Paradox:**
``` ``  Where are aliens?''  ↓  The universe is vast  ↓ There are  countless stars  ↓  The probability of life being born is not low  ↓  But  ↓  There is no evidence of intelligent life  ↓  Why?  ```
**One hypothesis: The Great Filter**
When civilization  reaches a certain stage,  it  inevitably faces a challenge (filter)  that causes  most civilizations to collapse. This is why there are no aliens .      
**The Great Filter of Humanity:**
 Right now  ,  climate change is happening  .  Can we overcome it?  If  we do ,  we 'll become a  Type I civilization. If we fail, we'll collapse . This is a test of cosmic history .

Appendix B: Formulas and rationale
### B.1 Calculation of CO2 fixation
B.1.1 Basic Assumptions
 Effects of increased nutrients: Nutrient  concentrations at a depth of 250m:  - Nitrate: 10-50 times higher than the surface  - Phosphate: 20-100 times higher than the surface  - Silicate: 50-200 times higher than the surface
Conservative assumption:  10-fold increase in phytoplankton abundance due to increased nutrients
[Area of effect]  Spread by spiral discharge:  Radius 150 m  Area: π × (150)² ≈ 70,000 m² = 0.07 km²  ```
B.1.2 Photosynthetic carbon fixation
```  [Primary production]  Primary production in temperate oceans:  Approximately 100-200 gC/m²/year (surface layer)
When nutrient restrictions are lifted:  Approximately 200-300 gC/m²/year
Conservative value:  20 gC/m²/year (nutrient increase only)
[Annual carbon fixation]  Affected area: 70,000 m²  Per unit area: 20 gC/m²/year  ↓  Total carbon fixation:  70,000 x 20 = 1,400,000 g = 1,400 kg = 1.4 ton carbon/year
[CO2 conversion]  Molecular weight of carbon: 12  Molecular weight of CO2: 44  Conversion factor: 44/12 ≈ 3.67  ↓ Fixed  CO2 amount:  1.4 × 3.67 ≈ 5.1 ton CO2/year  ↓  Approximately 5 ton CO2/year/unit (conservative)
B.1.3 Uncertainty
```  [Factors for the upside]  - Plankton growth rate more than 10 times  - The impact range is wider than expected  - Additional fixation by the food chain  ↓  Possible actual amount of CO2 5-10 ton/year
[Downward factors]  - Plankton growth rate less than 10 times  - Other limiting factors (light, temperature, etc.)  - Seasonal fluctuations  ↓  Worst case: 2-3 ton CO2/year
[Adopted value]  Conservative median value: 5 ton CO2/year/  unit
### B.2 Energy Balance Calculation
B.2.1 Power generation
 Solar  Panel Output: 1,200 W (STC) Sunshine  Hours (Equivalent): 4 h/day  Operating Rate: 17% (4/24)  Average Output: 1,200 × 0.17 = 204 W ≈ 200 W
[Wind power]  Rated output: 400 W (total of 4 units)  Average wind speed: 3 m/s  Power coefficient: approx. 0.3 (empirical)  Average output: 400 × 0.3 = 120 W
[Tidal power]  Rated output: 200 W (total of 4 units)  Average flow velocity: 0.3 m/s  Operating rate: 70%  Average output: 200 × 0.7 = 140 W
Total average power:  200 + 120 + 140 = 460 W
Daily power generation:  460 W × 24 h = 11,040 Wh ≈ 11 kWh/  day
#### B.2.2 Consumption
```  [Control system]  Microcomputer and sensor: 30 W  Communication equipment: 20 W  ↓  Total: 50 W x 24 h = 1.2 kWh/day
[Compressor]  Rated output: 5 kW  Operating time: Variable (duty cycle control)
[Other]  Lighting and backup: 30 W x 24 h = 0.7 kWh/day
[Basic consumption (excluding compressor)]  1.2 + 0.7 = 1.9 kWh/day ≈ 2 kWh/  day
#### B.2.3 Compressor operating time
```  [Surplus electricity]  Power generation: 11 kWh/day  Basic consumption: 2 kWh/day  Surplus: 9 kWh/day
[Operating time]  9 kWh / 5 kW = 1.8 hours/day
[Duty cycle]  1 hour ON, 2 hours OFF  ↓  Effective: 8 hours/day (33% duty)  ↓  Consumption: 8 × 5 = 40 kWh/day
[Balance]  Power generation: 11 kWh/day  Consumption: 40 kWh/day  Shortage: 29 kWh/day
[Solution]  Storage battery: 20 kWh  ↓  Charge on sunny days  and discharge in bad weather  ↓  Balance on average weekly
or
Increased solar panel capacity (doubled to 12 m²)  ↓  Average output: 400 W  Daily power generation: approx. 20 kWh/day  ↓  Operable with  ease```

1,000 units: $250,000/year  100,000 units: $25,000,000/  year````
#### B.3.3 Payback period (simple calculation)
 Cost: $16,500/unit  Annual revenue: $250/unit (carbon credits only)  Payback period: 16,500 /  250 = 66 years
[However]  If other benefits are included:  - Increase in fishery resources: $70/unit/year  - Ecosystem services: $100/unit/year  - Tourism value: $50/unit/year  ↓  Total: $470/unit/year  ↓  Payback period: 16,500 / 470 ≈ 35 years  ↓  Recoverable within the useful life (30-40 years)  ````
### B.4 Calculating the Integration Effect
#### B.4.1 CO2 reduction and absorption during global deployment
```  [Ocean Breathing System]  100,000 units × 5 ton/year = 500,000 ton/year (direct)
Restoring ocean absorption capacity:  Current ocean absorption: Approximately 10 billion tons/year  Decrease due to dead zones, etc.: Estimated 10-20%  Recovery effect: 10% improvement  ↓  10 billion × 0.1 = 1 billion tons/year
Total: Approximately 1 billion tons/year
[Improving urban environments]  50% of the world's urban population: 2.25 billion people  Urban CO2 emissions: Approximately 70% of the total  ↓  Target emissions: 40 billion x 0.7 x 0.5 = 14 billion tons/year
50% reduction rate: 7 billion tons/year  Absorption by urban greening: 500 million tons/year  ↓  Total: 7.5 billion tons/year
[Synergy]  Interaction between the two systems: Estimated 1 billion tonnes/year
[Total]  10 + 75 + 10 = 9.5 billion tons/year  ↓ Approximately 24  % of current human emissions (approximately 40 billion tons/year)

Appendix E: Frequently Asked Questions
### E.1 Technical Questions
**Q1: Does the Ocean Breathing System really work?**
A  : The basic principles (air lift, vertical circulation) are proven physical phenomena.  All of the individual component technologies (solar power generation, compressors, etc.) have also been put to practical use.  What's new is the "combination method" and the "spiral outlet," but  these are also based on the principles of fluid mechanics and are highly feasible. However  , the actual effects must be confirmed through demonstration tests.
**Q2: Will it be damaged in a typhoon?**
A  : The structural design takes typhoon resistance into consideration (maximum wind speed of 60 m/s is assumed).  The octahedron shape is structurally stable.  However, there is a risk of loss in the event of a typhoon that exceeds the expected magnitude. For  this reason, insurance is provided to cover the loss, and the design is continually improved.  The distributed layout limits the impact on the entire building even if a portion is lost.
**Q3: Won't it stop working due to biofouling?**
A  : Biofouling is unavoidable on marine structures.  As a countermeasure, we apply antifouling paint and clean them regularly (once a year). We  are also considering tolerating some biofouling and positively evaluating it as a fish reef effect.
**Q4: Do you really have enough energy?**
A  : Conservative calculations show that the system is slightly short of capacity, but this  can be achieved by using duty cycle control (intermittent operation) and storage batteries. Also  , doubling the solar panels (to 12m²) will provide ample operating space.  The energy balance will be optimized through demonstration testing.
**Q5: Has the effectiveness of spiral air outlets been proven?**
A  : It is based on the principles of fluid mechanics (Bernoulli effect, Coanda effect), but  the actual improvement in mixing efficiency (10 times) is based on model calculations and inferences. We  will confirm the effect through demonstration tests and optimize the shape as necessary.
### E.2 Environmental Impact Questions
**Q6: Won't red tide occur?**
A  : Nutrient supply is localized (within a radius of approximately 150 meters) and  mimics natural upwelling.  Phased deployment and continuous monitoring  will allow for immediate response if there are signs of red tide.  Past upwelling areas (areas with natural nutrient supply)  have been highly productive, and red tides are rare  .
**Q7: Won't this disrupt the ecosystem?**
A  : It assists natural vertical circulation and  basically restores the original state.  However, there is a possibility of unexpected effects, so  we will conduct a thorough environmental impact assessment and conduct continuous monitoring. If any problems arise ,  we will stop operation and take measures.
**Q8: What is the impact on deep-sea creatures?**
A  : The impact of air injection is expected to be limited, but  the demonstration test will also involve surveying deep-sea organisms.  250m depth is the "mesopelagic zone," and the biota there is not as unique as that found in the deep sea (usually 1000m or deeper)  , but we will carefully evaluate the situation  .
### E.3 Economic Questions
**Q9: Is this really economically viable?**
A  : The payback period is approximately 35 years (including multiple benefits), which  is right at the end of the useful life (30-40 years).  If the price of carbon credits rises, the payback period will be shorter.  Also, if you think of it as "insurance" for climate change measures,  the benefits have a value that cannot be measured in monetary terms (the survival of humanity)  .
**Q10: Who will cover the costs?**
A  : We are considering various funding sources:  - Government budget (environmental costs)  - Private investment (green bonds, ESG investments)  - International organizations (climate funds)  - Carbon credit revenues: Initially, public funding will be the main source, but once the effectiveness is proven ,  we expect private funding to take over.
**Q11: Can it be introduced in developing countries?**
A  : This is possible through technology transfer and financial support.  The blueprints will be open source, so they  can be manufactured in various countries. Funding  will come from international climate funds and aid from developed countries.
### E.4 Implementation Questions
**Q12: When can I start?**
A  : Preparations can begin immediately after this paper is published (November 2025).  Once funding and systems are in place, prototype production will begin in Q2 2025.  The first unit is scheduled to be installed in Q4 2025, and demonstration testing will begin  .
**Q13: Can individuals participate?**
A  : Yes, there are many ways to get involved:  - Sharing information (spreading via social media, etc.)  - Providing funding (crowdfunding, etc.)  - Local practice (rooftop greening, composting, etc.)  - Providing expertise (if you are a researcher or engineer)  - Volunteering (events, awareness-raising, etc.) There  is a role for everyone.
**Q14: How can we lobby the government and businesses?**
A  : There are several ways to do this:  - Submit a request to lawmakers or the government  - Contact companies by email or social media  - Propose a proposal at the general meeting of shareholders as a shareholder  - Collect signatures or petitions  - Post in the media  - Express your opinion by voting . The first step  is to speak out.
### E.5 Skeptical Questions
**Q15: Isn't this just another "dream story"?**
```  A: This paper differs from other proposals in the following ways:  1. It uses only existing technology (proven);  2. It presents detailed design specifications  ; 3. It calculates and presents economics  ; 4. It clearly identifies risks  ; 5. It concretely outlines an implementation roadmap;  6. It is open-source and verifiable.  It is not a dream, but a feasible plan.  ```
**Q16: Why hasn't anyone done this before?**
A  : There are several reasons:  1. The concept of deep sea aeration existed, but  it was difficult to design an energy self-sufficient system.  2. The economic feasibility was not fully evaluated.  3. The urgency of the climate crisis was not fully recognized.  4. An integrated perspective (ocean + city) was lacking  .

### E.5 Skeptical Questions (cont.)
**Q16: Why hasn't anyone done this before? (continued)**
The technology  was there, but  there had been a lack of effort to integrate it and design it comprehensively, including economics.  The idea of open sourcing is also a new approach. Now  is the time when the urgency and maturity of the technology coincide.
**Q17: Surely the IPCC scientists couldn't have overlooked this?**
A  : The IPCC does an excellent job, but it has the following characteristics:  1. Emphasis on scientific certainty (conservative)  2. Consideration of policy implications (cautious)  3. Focus on reviewing existing research (limited new proposals)
This paper:  - Proposes technical implementation (outside the scope of the IPCC)  - Emphasizes non-linear scenarios (which the IPCC acknowledges but refrains from)  - An integrated approach (multidisciplinary)
It is not intended to negate the IPCC, but rather to complement it  .
**Q18: If the climate crisis could be solved with such a simple solution, it wouldn't be a struggle, right?**
A  : It's not "easy."  It's technically feasible, but implementation would require:  - huge funding ($4.5 trillion)  - 25 years of sustained effort  - international cooperation  - social consensus  - and political determination  .
While technical solutions exist,  the biggest challenge lies in social and political implementation. However  , it is not impossible.  Humanity has overcome great challenges before.
**Q19: What if I fail?**
A  : We recognize the risks (see Chapter 12),  but the risk of failure  is far greater than the risk of doing nothing.
Even if you fail:  - You gain data and lessons learned  - You can apply them to your next attempt  - Even partial success is valuable
If we do nothing:  - The climate crisis will surely worsen  - We will run out of options
 Smart risk - taking is what's needed now.
### E.6 Philosophical Questions
**Q20: Isn't human intervention in nature itself a problem?**
A  : Humans are already interfering with nature on a large scale (burning fossil fuels, deforestation, etc.).  The question is the quality of that intervention.
Destructive intervention: Ignoring the laws of nature, one-way, unsustainable.  This proposal: Follows the laws of nature, is circular, and sustainable.
We can't have zero interference with nature (with a population of 8 billion),  so we should intervene wisely.
The Ocean Breathing System is an attempt to restore  the balance of nature that has been disrupted by humans, using human technology to assist in this process . 
**Q21: Isn't this just technology-first? Isn't it more important to change our lifestyles?**
A  : You need both, not just one.
This paper also covers:  - Improving urban environments: including lifestyle changes  - Recycling-based society: changing consumption behavior  - Community regeneration: changing social relationships
Technology is a means, not an end in itself.  The goal is a "sustainable civilization,"  which requires both technology and lifestyle changes.
Technology alone is not enough,  nor are lifestyle changes alone enough. An  integrated approach is key.
**Q22: Shouldn't humanity be wiped out? For the sake of the Earth.**
A  : There are two problems with this view:
1. Humans are part of nature.  Humans are not the only "evil" species.
2. Even if humans disappear, the effects of climate change will remain.  The CO2 already released will remain for hundreds of years and  continue to affect other living organisms.
Rather:  human intelligence and technology  should be used to restore, not destroy.
If humanity can build a sustainable civilization, it will be beneficial  for the ecosystem of the entire planet .
Instead of giving up,  we should take responsibility  .
### E.7 Practical Questions
**Q23: Where are the links to GitHub and NOTE?**
A  : It is published at:
GitHub: https://github.com/InchaComisho  NOTE: https://note.com/inchacomusho  X (old Twitter): @rissya0214

All suggestions are welcome.  This is an open source project  .
**Q25: How do I donate or invest?**
A  : At this time (November 2025), we do not have a system in place to accept direct donations or investments,  as we do not have a fully organized organization .
However:  - Spreading information  - Local practice  - Influencing related companies and organizations  - Requesting the government
These are also important investments.
Once the funding is ready, we  will make an announcement on GitHub or NOTE.
**Q26: I would like to participate in prototype manufacturing?**
A  : Thank you very much.  You can participate in the following ways:
[Engineers and researchers]  Cooperation in design, analysis, and testing
[Manufacturer]  Parts supply and manufacturing cooperation
[Funding provider]  Prototype manufacturing costs provided
[Other]  Ideas, networks, and public relations cooperation
 We plan to publish recruitment information on GitHub and NOTE.
**Q27: I want to create an eco-district in my city?**
A  : Great! We recommend the following steps:
1. Gather a group of people (at least 10-20 people)  2. Share this paper and deepen understanding  3. Research the current situation in the region (environment, resources, issues, etc.)  4. Create a feasible plan (starting on a small scale)  5. Approach the government and businesses  6. Start a pilot project
We  plan to build a platform for sharing case studies on NOTE and GitHub .
### E.8 Time Questions
**Q28: Is it really only five years? Is it definitely too late after 2030?**
```  A: It's not *absolutely* too late, but  it will be extremely difficult.
Reasons:  - Time lag (20-30 years)  - Tipping point threshold (around +2°C)  - Current pace of warming
If starting in 2030:  Effects will be seen in 2050-2060  ↓  At that point, there is a possibility that temperatures will already be above +2.5℃  ↓  Many tipping points will be exceeded  ↓  Control will be difficult
Therefore, 2025-2030  is the "last chance."
 However, we should not give up even after 2030. Better  late than never.
**Q29: Isn't 25 years too long? Can't it be done sooner?**
A  : 25 years is necessary for the following reasons:
 1. 100,000 Ocean Breathing Systems - Time-consuming to build -  for urban renovations around the world
2. It takes time to build a social consensus
3. Phased deployment is safe (environmental impact confirmation)
4. Time lag (20-30 years for effects to be seen)
Of course, it would be best if we could accelerate the process.  With sufficient funding, human resources, and social consensus,  it may be possible to shorten the time to 15-20 years.
However, there is also the risk of failure if you rush too quickly. Balance  is key.
**Q30: What if we can't make it by 2050?**
```  A: Even in that case, don't give up.
Even in 2060 and 2070:  - No further worsening of global warming  - Partial recovery  - Foundation for future generations
is possible.
The worst-case scenario (+7-8°C) and  the next-best scenario (+3-4°C)  will have completely different impacts on human civilization.
At any point,  it's worth taking action.
However, the sooner the better, for sure  .
